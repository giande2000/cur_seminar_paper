On ‘appropriation’. A critical reappraisal of the concept and its application in global art practices*

This paper advocates a reconceptualisation of appropriation in order to provide a better understanding of global art practices. In the first instance, I suggest we have to consider the relation of appropriation to cultural change. Early twentieth-century theories of cultural change and cultural contact (in German-speaking anthropology, in the United States and in Britain) were clearly interested in the ‘migration’ of particular elements (symbolic and material) across cultural boundaries, but suffered overall from a holistic view of bounded cultures. Recent theories of cultural globalisation, on the other hand, do not pay sufficient attention to the individual actors (as opposed to groups of individuals) in cross-cultural contact. Hybridisation, creolisation, transculturation and other concepts focus more generically on mixtures of different cultural practices in entire societies or groups of individuals, but less on individual strategies. The paper suggests that we might think of cultures as open systems where individual actors negotiate access to, and traffic in, symbolic elements which have no fixed meaning.1 The approach here is primarily of a synthetic and theoretical nature. In order not to distract from the main thrust of the argument, I will therefore offer only occasional and brief examples.2 The article then critically discusses the concept of ‘appropriation’ * I am grateful to Peter Flügel, Jonathan Friedman, Stuart Morgan, Vivian Schelling and Chris Wright for their helpful comments on an earlier draft. I also benefited from the comments of three anonymous reviewers for this journal.

The real significance of the growth of transnational cultures, one might indeed argue, is often not the new cultural experience that they themselves can offer people – for its frequently rather restricted in scope and depth – but their mediating possibilities. The transnational cultures provide points of entry into other territorial cultures (Hannerz 1992: 251).

Defining appr opriation In the following I shall first comment on the term appropriation in contemporary art practices, and then suggest a hermeneutic approach for understanding its role in processes of cultural change and globalisation. In art history, appropriation in the narrow sense has been defined as The direct duplication, copying or incorporation of an image (painting, photograph, etc.) by another artist who represents it in a different context, thus completely altering its meaning and questioning notions of originality and authenticity (Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art and Artists: Stangos 1994: 19).

‘Originality’ and ‘authenticity’, of course, are notions central to the western canon of art since the Renaissance. In more recent times, appropriation is sometimes characterised more frankly, as a practice by which ‘an artist may ‘steal’ another pre-existing image and sign it as his/her own’, whereas ‘reappropriation connotes “stealing”’ an image, symbol, or statement from outside the realm of art’ (The Bullfinch Pocket Dictionary of Art Terms: Diamond 1992). In terms of the western legal notion of individual property, artistic appropriation implies an infringement of copyright, as Coombe points out:

Coombe (1993; 1998); Strathern (1996); Ziff and Rao (1997: 1); Brown (1998); Harrison (1999a; 1999b); Benthall (1999). 4 Before culture can be transmitted, there is of course the related issue of ‘cultural acquisition’ (or what in the past was called ‘enculturation’. For more recent approaches using the insights of cognitive psychology, see Bloch (1991); Boyer (1993); Hirschfeld and Gelman (1994). 5 On recognition of otherness, see the interesting studies by Kubler (1991; 1996) regarding western scholars of Pre-Columbian art.

and evaluates the usefulness of applying the term ‘appropriation’ in the analysis of cross-cultural communication in a global world. The focus is on the visual arts, yet the discussion of appropriation has important implications for studies of diasporas in the process of globalisation, since these involve particular conceptualisations of identity, authorship and ownership of cultural and intellectual property.3 I am also interested in more general terms in the processes of cultural transmission,4 cultural exchange, and recognition of otherness,5 which, I argue, become operative through appropriation by individual artists. Thus my approach aims to shift the traditional units of analysis in anthropology, namely from whole ‘groups of individuals’ and bounded cultures (the traditional emphasis of anthropology, and of the anthropology of art) to the individual producers of artistic works and their role in the process of globalisation, as well as cross-cultural contacts generally. In fact, artists are conceived of here as an ‘interface’ in this process, nodal points in the global system that provide ‘entry into other cultures’ (Hannerz 1996: 39–42). As Hannerz puts it succinctly,

The late Latin appropriare, ‘to make one’s own’ (deriving from proprius ‘one’s own’) is at the root of subsequent applications of the term and also surfaces in debates on the return of ‘cultural property’, where the political implications of cultural appropriation, both of tangibles (such as the Elgin Marbles) and of intangibles (i.e. ‘intellectual’ and ‘spiritual’ property) have been discussed at some length.6 Appropriation, copying,7 or even citation and reference to the work of previous artists are established practices throughout the history of art (with obviously changing connotations according to the historical period), but they have become particularly salient to ‘(post)modern’ art practices, which, as Rosalind Krauss highlights, challenge traditional western notions of exclusive authorship and any accepted supremacy of the original (high) over its copy (low) (1989: 8–10; also Schwartz 1996). In contrast, Buchloh has characterised the strategies of appropriation and montage in twentieth-century modern art as ‘allegorical procedures’ (1982: 46), implying obvious changes of meaning in the process. On the other hand, appropriation for many Latin American and other ‘Third World’ artists prolongs and extends the experience of what they claim as the original, while also investing it with new meaning8 and serving as a strategy for identity construction. This bears some resemblance to the original Roman understanding in, for example, the appropriation of Greek art, where the practice had a symbolically transformative character that went beyond mere copying (cf. Krauss 1989: 10). Consequently, there is no ‘original’ after all. As Friedman (1997; 1999) argues, cultures are always impure, consisting of heterogeneous elements ab initio. There is, so to say, nothing before hybridity, in fact, the term is probably misleading, as it presupposes a transition from pure elements which, through a blending process, become impure, or hybrid. For want of a better term, ‘originary syncretism’ has been proposed by Amselle (1998: 1). It captures well the dilemma of the underlying terminological contradictions between ‘originary’ and ‘syncretism’ (as syncretism, like hybridity, presupposes an earlier non-syncretic state), and tries to dispel any notion of a reified original state or homogenous culture. Arguably, then, in a more general sense most cultural practice is ‘appropriation’ in that it is part of a continuum (both historical and spatial) of all human endeavour in this respect – an assertion not alien to the politically and culturally ‘disenfranchised’ in western contemporary societies, as the following quote, which comes from a

6 See n. 5. 7 My discussion, relevant to visual artworks, is interested in the process of copying, which implies changes of meaning, not those pretending to have the same meaning, i.e. fakes, on which see Phillips (1986–7). On virtually identical copies, or counterfeits with yet different values attributed to them by collectors in the world of Rock and popular music, see Jamieson (1999). 8 Cf. also Paternosto (1996: 192), who makes the point more generally, following partly Kubler (1962: 108) that artists across different cultures and in different historical periods can retrieve and recreate meaning through appropriation (although Paternosto does not explicitly discuss the term).

It is important to note here that the law assigns works a category and a degree of protection at the time of origin, not at shifting points of public reception. Hence, an artistic work that copies the work of another, regardless of the social critique or political point the artist believes she is making, is a copyright infringement and remains one even if the artworld comes to regard the work/copy as an authentic masterpiece (Coombe 1993: 257; cf. also Coombe 1998).

Well, let’s take this supposedly theoretical ideal of ‘appropriation’. With the high school kids that I teach, there is an intrinsic knowledge about appropriation, because for them in a sense, all cultural production has to be stolen. White culture historically never let you proclaim the culture that you had. It’s not talked about, it’s not taught, it’s not on TV. And even within a group of young artists – for graffiti writers, to bite something and make it your own is a sign of greatness. Tap dancers build whole repertoires of stolen steps. There’s the idea within folk culture of how imagery gets communicated, appropriated, and turned into new imagery (Member of Group Material, interviewed by Critical Art Ensemble 1998: 29).

In what follows, I shall adopt an extended definition of cultural appropriation ‘as the taking – from a culture that is not one’s own – of intellectual property, cultural expressions or artefacts, history and ways of knowledge’ (Ziff/Rao 1997: 1, citing the Resolution of the Writers’ Union of Canada 1992). The problem with such a definition for many artists is that they appropriate cultures which at the same time are and are not regarded as their own. In fact, the construction of new identities by these artists often evokes ancestral ties to indigenous cultures, either by presumed biological and/or cultural descent and belonging (even in those cases where artists descend from Europeans), as well as ties to the international, still largely westernised art canon mediated by the ‘art world’. Howard Becker (1982) introduced this useful term to the sociology of art to describe the collective ensemble of producers (for example, artists, critics), institutions (museums, galleries), the art-consuming public, and the artworks themselves which are connected in complex social relations.9 A further issue is that the parameters used in the above definitions are problematic, because meanings of ‘appropriation’ and ‘culture’ are shifting according to context; especially since the latter has lost its exclusive definition as a bounded system of shared values and artefacts (or material representations) of a social group. Also, as has been pointed out in debates on cultural appropriation, those claiming a particular culture as their own, and thus challenging the ‘appropriation’ of elements of that culture by others, often themselves use ethnocentric constructs of culture as unchanging and what Coombe calls ‘possessive individualism’ (that objects, tangible or intangible belong to individuals) (Coombe 1993: 253). Thus, operating with rigid notions of cultures at both ends of the continuum between ‘origin’ and ‘copy’ leaves ‘appropriation’ in a straitjacket of cultural essentialism. Could, then, ‘appropriation’ be re-established as a concept to conceive of the brokering practices between different (and co-existing) cultural contexts by visual artists (and others, in a variety of cultural domains such as music, fashion and cuisine)? Obviously, such a reinstatement of ‘appropriation’ would have to account for the social and political dynamics involved. A crucial question is: who appropriates what, where and from whom? This implies a situating of appropriating practices in different 9 In the philosophy of art and art criticism, Arthur Danto (1964) first discussed the term in his essay ‘The artworld’. See also Danto (1992: 37), where he describes the historically conditioned institutional setting (museums, galleries, dealers and critics that confer on certain objects the status of art). For sociologists in the functionlist tradition of Talcott Parsons such as Howard Becker, and also for system theoreticians such as Niklas Luhmann, art is a sub-system (Teilsystem) of society (Luhmann 1995: 215ff.; cf. Sevänen 2001).

Appr opriation, cultural change and globalisation The effects of globalisation are not new, of course, nor is their study – as Sidney Mintz (1995;1998) frequently reminds us. It is therefore useful to revisit critically some historical antecedents of present concerns with the processes of cross-cultural contact and globalisation (see also Gingrich and Fox 2002). It is well known that the American variant of cultural anthropology (starting with Boas and Kroeber), as well as early twentieth-century German and Austrian anthropology (cf. Lowie 1937; Harris 1968; Mühlmann 1984; Gingrich 2002: 230), were eager to investigate cultural difference and culture change. Of course, the models then proposed of ‘cultural circles’ (Kulturkreislehre) and culture areas are long superseded, as is the idea of bounded, homogenous cultures. What is of interest here is the fact that terms such as ‘appropriation’ or ‘Aneignung’ (in German) – although rarely used explicitly – were conceptualised through ideas of cultural contact and the exchange of artefacts and belief systems between cultures (and their constitutive elements, such as symbols). However, a problem of the early diffusionists – especially German and Austrian ones such as Fritz Graebner and Father Wilhelm Schmidt – was that they conceived of culture change as a rather mechanical process. As Thurnwald pointed out in his critique of Graebner: From the old so-called ‘evolutionary’ point of view this concept [i.e. Kulturkreislehre] differed in that it assumed particular cultural centres and points of diffusion. However, how this transference was realised and what effect it had psycho-sociologically, was not the preoccupation of Graebner in his book Methode der Ethnologie. For him, transfers were realised mechanically, like transferring a piece from one museum case to another (Thurnwald 1931: 11; my translation).

It is not without irony, and rather uncanny that Thurnwald10 should refer to the museum, a principal site of appropriation in late nineteenth and early twentieth century (colonial) anthropology – the practices and continuing sites of representation which have been much critiqued by both discursive writing and visual artists’ installations.11 Early twentieth-century studies of ‘acculturation’ (promoted in the United States by Herskovits, Redfield and Beals, and in Germany, for instance, by Thurnwald) or of ‘culture contact’ (in the British Commonwealth) were not of course questioning the colonial politics of cultural appropriation, and on the whole were complicit with

power relations, which would go beyond the more formal approaches in art history where ‘appropriation’ has been defined as taking something out of one context and establishing it in a new one. Consequently, there would be a shift in emphasis towards social practice and agency as advocated by some recent writing in the anthropology of art (Gell 1998; Pinney and Thomas 2001). This in turn could account both for the way cultural forms become diasporic (and change their meanings), and the way the actors involved are often themselves in a diaspora in relation to what they claim as their cultures of origin.

colonialism.12 The conceptual interest was in the dynamics of cultural change as a result of increasing contact between cultures: usually between non-western cultures that had come into contact with Europeans, or less often between non-western cultures themselves. In early and mid twentieth-century anthropology cultures were conceived as wholes, that is as symbolic representations and material manifestations of bounded ‘groups of individuals’, as a famous memorandum on acculturation by Herskovits, Redfield and Linton stated in 1936. As such, models of cultural change and acculturation left little room for the consideration of the individual in society, a problem which I contend still persists in anthropology, and especially in the anthropology of art (see below, and Schneider 1996). The point was made indirectly by Bateson ([1936] 1973) in his rejoinder to the memorandum in which he suggested studying acculturation in relation to the individual child, calling this process ‘enculturation’. The overall neglect of the individual was not remedied by ‘culture and personality studies’ either, where individuals were simply conceived as representatives of their culture (for example, performing to patterns, according to Benedict 1934, or to a metaphysical ‘superorganic’, according to Kroeber 1917, or being moved by ‘Paideuma’, that is empathic emotion, according to Frobenius13). Before structuralism’s ahistorical approach to culture, anthropologists of the 1920s to 1940s in Germany, Austria and the United States were still partly informed by the broader schemes of earlier cultural evolutionists and diffusionists. Using participant observation, they were particularly interested in studying cultural change and culture contact as processes of cultural borrowing (kulturelle Entlehnung14) and more specifically as appropriation, even ‘piratical acculturation’ – that is appropriation through warfare, which some evolutionists saw as the earliest form of culture (ex)change (cf. McGee 1898).15 To sum up, these early approaches ultimately aimed at uncovering the laws, rules or at least a logic of culture change – the kind of grand theory of which the late twentieth century understandably became suspicious (Gingrich and Fox 2002: 4 –5). Of course, with the above I do not pretend to have exhausted the discussion on early twentieth-century diffusionism in relation to appropriation and culture change; this would merit a separate study. Nevertheless it is curious, and perhaps symptomatic, that current concerns with cultural hybridisation – despite attempts by Hannerz (1992; 1996), and Thomas (1991; 1999) for instance – have not yet led to a similar theorisation of the actual, material processes of cultural change within the global system. As yet there has been no comprehensive attempt by post-modernists and post-structuralists to reveal the logic, laws or mechanics of global cultural processes – supposing that there are certain regularities16 – that might compare in scope and breadth with the older acculturation paradigms.

Appr opriation as hermeneutic pr ocedur e The point here is not to revive the antiquated theories of acculturation and culture change of the early twentieth century, but to reconnect with the interest in appropriation and focus on individual practices that mediate between different cultural levels in the process of globalisation. For anthropology, it is important to develop a proper concept of appropriation: one that takes into account (i) the ‘original’ context of an artefact and its producers; (ii) the artefact itself; and (iii) the appropriating person or agent. Further to what has been said in the introduction, I should emphasise that most often there is no absolute original (which is why I use inverted commas), but just a context in which something has been known to be produced for the first time (which might yet be a variation on a previous theme now lost). From a hermeneutic point of view, a new concept of appropriation then has to retain the ‘understanding’ or ‘comprehending’ nature of the appropriating act. At the same time, it has to reinstall the intentions of the ‘originating’ producer, whilst doing justice to the artefact. From a purely hermeneutic of view, the aspiration for such an encompassing concept probably must remain unfulfilled. Thus Ricoeur, one of the few contemporary philosophers who has specifically written about appropriation, points out that: An interpretation is not authentic unless it culminates in some form of appropriation (Aneignung) if by that term we understand the process by which one makes one’s own (eigen) what was initially other or alien (fremd)’ (Ricoeur 1981: 178; German in original)

Appropriation is opposed to distanciation by Ricoeur, but its practice does not mean taking simple possession of the other. To the contrary, the term implies in the first instance dispossessing oneself of the narcissistic ego in order to engender a new selfunderstanding, not a mere congeniality with the Other (Ricoeur 1981: 191–3).18 ‘Relinquishment is a fundamental moment of appropriation and distinguishes it from any form of ‘taking possession’ (Ricoeur 1981: 191). Yet anthropology, which owes its very nature (encompassing ethnographic research and cultural analysis) to the producing, ‘originating’ cultures, cannot stop here. It cannot privilege, as during its colonial past, the appropriating practices of the powerful, nor can it just stop at the artefact and its interpretations, as hermeneutic philosophers must do with ‘texts’. Somehow, anthropology must find a way to reveal, as social and cultural relations, the actual mediating process which – via objects, 17 For some useful discussion of comparative research on contemporary world arts, see Fillitz (2002). 18 Ricoeur is inspired primarily by Gadamer’s Truth and method; see Gadamer (1960).

Regarding future research, we have to ask whether processes of cultural change in a global setting are distinct from those between ‘single’ cultures previously investigated through paradigms of acculturation or culture contact, or whether the rate of change simply accelerates or becomes qualitatively different, and now functions according to parameters other than those that operated in the past. Finally, the status and usefulness of cross-cultural comparisons as indicators of globalisation have to be assessed and contrasted with superseded notions of acculturation.17

19 Cf. Philosophy of right, §§ 38–40, 50–60. 20 For which, see such classic writings in economic anthropology as Mauss (1990), Sahlins (1972) and more recent reconceptualisations such as Strathern (1989). 21 See also Moore (1990: 94–7). 22 Arguably, our usage of ‘cultural appropriation’ falls under the category of ‘abstract appropriation’ (as, for example, it is present in property rights), and not ‘concrete appropriation’, that is the material appropriation qua extraction of natural resources (for these terms and a full discussion of the ‘appropriation of nature’, see Ingold 1986: 12).

artefacts, ideas and language – takes place between culturally different social actors. Of course, in an ideal speech situation with perfectly equal individuals – or for that matter a social or political situation – Hegel’s old assertion would still hold: that it is through marking out or defining personal property (as well as taking spiritual possession of it) that the individual as a person endowed with individual will is constituted, and that it is precisely through the transfer of property that individuals manifest their free will (one to give or transfer, the other to take or appropriate).19 The problem here (as not only Marx realised), is that despite the fundamental equality of the exchange relation itself, people in such transactions are not equal, which is both true for transactions within societies and between societies. Anthropology, then, has to develop a concept of appropriation that takes account of the inherent inequality in transactions as cultural transactions (as opposed to economic transactions20), and yet allows for the possibility, following partly Riceour, of ‘understanding’ by appropriating.21 The latter is required because concepts of appropriation have all too often focused exclusively on the economic and legal aspects of appropriation,22 even when discussing cultural change. Such approaches therefore neglect the possibility of understanding in the hermeneutic sense, that is changing one’s own cultural practices as a result of interpreting the other’s artefact (or any other cultural manifestation). A move away from formalist approaches, as advocated by Coombe (1993: 249), who distinguishes between intellectual, cultural and real property, thus allows different types of property and their appropriation to be analysed as cultural constructions of things and persons. However, when in an unequal relationship from the viewpoint of the Other, appropriation appears as alienation. In the history of philosophy, especially in Hegel and Marx, this has been a much discussed concept. Here, however, alienation is useful because it restores to the ‘appropriated’ a status as experiential subject, albeit a status that is less powerful than the appropriating agent. Alienation also has implications for movements of cultural resistance, for example, among indigenous people, where appropriation is contrasted with ‘cultural autonomy’: the right to determine the disposal of one’s own cultural traditions (Todd 1990: 24). This is especially the case in post-colonial societies where artists’ appropriating and reinterpreting practices are situated as claims against the unequal power relations of the world system. How, then, can we develop a concept of appropriation that comprehends the process linking artists, artefacts (and their ‘original’ producers) and the new artworks resulting from the appropriative process? One possibility is by introducing a concept of ‘agency’, as Gell (1998) has done, focusing on actors rather than objects of art. Although Gell does not specifically focus on appropriation, one could construct a model which takes account of the intentionalities of the actors involved and of the functions artefacts and artworks (or parts of these, such as symbols) perform within their respective social context. Yet with this procedure we would not really have explained the transformative aspect, manifested in the final artwork (including incor-

23 Cf. Coutts-Smith (1991: 28); for creativity in art and anthropology, see Lavie et al. (1993), and Whitten and Whitten (1993). 24 On the related discussion of ‘alienability’ and inalienability’ of objects in gift exchanges and European and non-western encounters, see Thomas (1991). There is also something to be said about visual artworks being inherently ‘inalienable’ art forms because they are complete in themselves and not supposed to be changed in their finite forms. This contrasts with theatre and music, where representation varies with performance (cf. Zolberg 1990: 169–71). 25 Maranhão (1986); Crapanzano (1990). Toren (1991: 277) speaks of the ‘fugitive conservatism’ of appropriation in post-colonial situations where, paradoxically, new elements are introduced while conserving other elements of a specific culture (she takes the example of tapestry representations of Leonardo’s Last Supper in Fiji).

porated symbols of other cultures) as a result of the appropriating process, nor the change induced by the artist in the art world or his or her society more generally. Therefore, let us return for a moment to the hermeneutic approach. I suggest developing a concept of appropriation based on understanding the other – or the other’s products: artefacts – that is appropriation as a practice and experience of ‘learning’, similar to what Paternosto (1999: 22) has outlined, albeit only in preliminary form, for the work of contemporary abstract artists inspired by ancient Latin American art. Learning through visual experimentation then stresses the transformative aspect of appropriation, as suggested earlier. Following this line of reasoning, we would arrive at a concept that reconciles the element of agency, with the element of ‘understanding’. This might also resolve a rather formalist contradiction in the classic canon which set an inferior practice of appropriation (implying copying) against the superior idea of creativity (implying the originating genius).23 Now, concerning contemporary art, we can still ask what the ‘original’ intentions were of those from whom artists appropriate, without falling into the simple trap of assuming ‘dialogue’ (what Ricoeur’s concept of appropriation is obviously not about). What would have to be restored is the intentionality of the Other, by giving it its proper voice, and as such, dealienating it from the act of appropriation.24 So far, the anthropology of art has not sufficiently investigated and theorised appropriation as a major feature of culture change. The term is conspicuously absent from most subject indexes, including most recently Gell (1998). One exception are Marcus and Myers, who suggest that appropriation concerns the art world’s ideology, discursive practices or microtechnologies for assimilating difference (other cultural materials) in various ways. Such an assimilation of difference is generally accomplished by stripping cultural materials of their original context, or using representations of an original context in such a way as to allow for an embedding of this influence within the activities and interests of producing art’ (Marcus and Myers 1995: 33). Thomas (1999: 141; 2001) also calls for a theorisation of the term, but is more occupied with the politics implied in Australian ‘white’ settler art appropriating Aboriginal culture. And despite evocative titles, such as ‘Appopriating images’ (Tomaselli 1996), writing in the field of visual anthropology has not theorised appropriation either. Thus the way forward, as I suggested earlier, is to conceptualise appropriation as one of the principal practices underlying any culture contact or exchange, and therefore underlying any dialogical situation of ‘understanding’ each ‘other’.25 This aspect

26 Cf. Lips (1937). 27 Cf. Moreiras (1995: 3). 28 Camnitzer gives the revealing example of the Cuban painter Amalia Paláez, who tells in an interview ‘about a visitor who, seeing a painting in progress, expressed surprise and admiration about the sudden elimination of black in her work. He interpreted it as an unexpected creative renewal of the artist, while th real reason was that her supply of black had run out and she was unable to replace it (a fact she did not reveal to the visitor).’ (Camnitzer 1994: 315–6, referring to Seoanne Gallo 1987: 192–3).

of appropriation has to do with the essential elements of difference that mark out the degrees of divergence and convergence between cultures, and the ‘alterative’ processes of recognising such differences. Boon pointed to the process of how cultures, perfectly commonsensical from within, nevertheless flirt with their own ‘alternities’, gain critical self-distance, formulate complex (rather than simply reactionary) perspectives on others, embrace negativities, confront (even admire) what they themselves are not (Boon 1982: 19, his italics). Appropriation needs cognitive difference (even and especially when it arises out of sameness [Harrison 1999b: 239]). However, historically speaking, it has occurred frequently in situations of real power difference, where ‘appropriating the nonwestern in a western context always underlines the subjective agency of the west, and the unequal passivity of the other’ (Barkan and Bush 1995: 13). Conversely, it is precisely in its own appropriations of the west that the non-west becomes the active historical agent in this ‘alterative’ encounter, one that subverts and deconstructs the ideological terrain of its present and former colonial masters (one only has to think here of such classic works as Julius Lips’ The savage hits back,26 or Jean Rouch’s films such as Les maîtres fous [1953], for example). It is in these instances that the alienating aspect of appropriation is contested, and an attempt is made to transcend what remains in terms of dialogical exchange, a dissymetry of power and representation.27 In situations of economic dependency and restricted access to international art markets, appropriation can develop a dynamic sui generis, as Camnitzer emphasises in his analysis of Cuban art (1994: 302). Appropriation in Cuba is both an historically well established practice, based on the experience of cultural syncretism, and a practice that can work in several directions: these include appropriations from past and present indigenous and African cultures in Cuba, as well as from international art. In practical terms, appropriation also re-signifies imported elements, and often uses them as replacements in aesthetic solutions where specific parts, elements or ingredients have not been available locally.28 Appropriation in its broader cultural sense (coupled with cognate terms such as adoption or assimilation) is of interest here, as it is through this strategy and its mechanisms and techniques, of which appropriation within contemporary art constitutes a special case, that symbols and artefacts currently migrate not only from one culture to another, but in the context of globalisation (i.e. in a globalised art market/‘art world’) also become available on a worldwide scale (undergoing a concomitant process of commodification and re-contextualisation [cf. Appadurai 1996 and Thomas 1991]). As mentioned before, appropriation in its formal sense means a taking out of one context and putting in another, yet the extended meaning that I have been advocating sees it as a hermeneutic procedure, which consequently implies not only that cultural elements are invested with new signification but also that those who appropriate are being transformed. As Thomas commented wryly on the early asymmetrical exchanges

Conclusion To summarise: appropriation, I suggest, is more than one-to-one transferral; its hermeneutic potential implies a resignification of meaning against the background of a structural imbalance between what (or who) is appropriated, and what (or who) is alienated. A revised concept of appropriation is also advocated in order to do justice to individual actors in the global context; individual agency having been neglected both by earlier paradigms of culture change and by more recent theories of globalisation and the anthropology of art. The emphasis on social agency has to be 29 The Argentine anthropologist García-Canclini (1995), on the other hand, presented a powerful thesis of understanding Latin American cultures as hybrid cultures. Cf. also other recent work by Acha et al. (1991); Rowe and Schelling (1991); Yúdice (1992); Chanady (1994); Echevarría (1994); and Larraín (1996). 30 Similar to what Lévi-Strauss claimed for the meaning of myth: i.e. that ‘a myth’ is constituted by all its variants. See also the work by anthropologists on the epidemiology of concepts by Latour (1986) and Sperber (1996: 77). 31 Cf. also Thomas (1991); Kramer (1993 [1986]); and Taussig (1994).

between Europeans and indigenous peoples in the Pacific: ‘To say that black bottles were given does not tell us what was received’ (Thomas 1991: 108). More recently, Thomas has pointed to appropriation as a two-way process, and to the inherent ‘unstable duality’ between rejection and acceptance of both giving to and taking from the Other (Thomas 2001: 139, 150). One effect of the appropriation of European (western) elements in non-western contexts is often the subversion of their ‘original’ meaning, a process which can be confusing to a western observer, as there is an inclination in the west to take familiar terms at face-value, especially when analytical categories, such as hybridisation, syncretism, imitation and copying all make reference to the supposed existence and validity of an original form from which secondary meaning can be derived. Gombrich (1966: 83–8) suggested that subsequent stylistic categories of art (like Classical, Romanesque, Gothic) basically mask two essential categories: the classical and the non-classical, which were used as exclusive terms to distinguish between ‘us’ and ‘them’ – or by extension, I would argue, between tradition and innovation, ‘originals’ and derivations. Friedman (1999) similarly has deconstructed the concept of hybridity as a masked essentialism.29 The point I made already is that if there is no ‘original’ after all, any notion of a composite original can only be arrived at through the study of the distribution, or epidemiology, of its many variants.30 While undoubtedly one part of human creativity is capable of creating ex novo, another part continuously recomposes, realigns and rejoins old elements, while slightly altering them to create new forms, sometimes in almost endless variations on one form (cf. Kubler’s 1962 notion of ‘series’). Within post-colonial discourse such a subversion of meaning is a more general feature, where peripheral ‘third world’ cultural practices assert their right to appropriate and reinterpret cultural artefacts from the centre,31 as a claim of post-colonial societies against the uneven ‘power geometry to the processes of globalisation’ (Inda and Rosaldo 2001: 13). Appadurai (1996: 32) has spoken of ‘indigenisation’ in this context, but I prefer the term ‘appropriation’, as it does not carry the reifying undertone (‘the indigenous’) at the receiving end, and can be used by any group or individual however their identity is constituted, whether they are western or non-western.

contextualised by the transformative act of appropriation, which, as outlined above, is better understood as a hermeneutic practice. This is to say that explanations for appropriative choices will have to be sought by investigating the interplay between changing definitions or conceptualisations of cultural traditions and nationhood and individual identity claims. It is at the intersection of the two that the recognition of otherness operates – a feature that is vital to the appropriation process itself.
