I want to start by introducing you to Tom.
Tom just started his UX Design studies and is working on his very first project: designing a meditation app.
Like every designer, Tom starts with a quick research for some inspiration. He learns that meditation has its roots in Hindu and Buddhist traditions from South and East Asia. Inspired by that, he wants to make his app feel authentic.
So he looks at pictures of meditation for design ideas. And he finds an image of Buddha and thinks, “That’s perfect for an app icon!”
Then he comes across some beautiful traditional Buddhist patterns and uses it as his background.
He calls the app Zenify — and adds a gamified element where users can collect karma points for meditating regularly.
To make the business model more attractive, he adds a premium subscription called Find Your Nirvana.
Tom feels proud of his work. He’s created something beautiful, functional, and meaningful.
But… if we take a second to think about it, I think we can all agree that Tom has made some questionable choices.
He just took budhist elemtents and integrated them into his app without really engaging with the content or symbols and their meaning
So let’s ask: When does cultural inspiration become cultural appropriation?
Now, this story about Tom is made up and might be a bit exaggerated — but honestly, it’s not that far from reality.
When I looked through real meditation and mindfulness apps on the Play Store, or through concepts on Behance and Dribbble, I didn’t find anything overtly offensive.
But I did find a lot of subtle similarities:
lotus icons, Buddha-like silhouettes, the use of the word “Zen,” or gamified “karma points.”
And that’s actually part of the problem.
Cultural appropriation in UX often hides in plain sight, embedded in design choices that seem harmless, but actually strip cultural elements from their context and turn them into decoration.

So to unpack this topic we’ll look at:
What cultural appropriation actually means,
Why it’s important for us as UX designers to be aware of it,
Why it’s so hard to clearly define,
What kind of harm it can cause,
Whether appropriation is always wrong — or if it risks limiting creativity,
And finally, how we can move from appropriation to appreciation — with some practical ideas for our own design practice.
okay so: what do we actually mean when we say “appropriation”? How would you describe the word “appropriation” in your own words?
Exactly — it has to do with taking, or using something that belongs to someone else.
The word actually comes from the Latin appropriare, which means “to make one’s own.”
(Ashley &  Plesch, 2002, p. 2) (Schneider, 2003, p. 217)
when we talk about cultural appropriation, we’re talking about taking elements from another culture and making them one’s own — often without understanding, permission, or respect for their original meaning or context.
There isn’t one single definition of cultural appropriation many philosophers describe it in slightly different ways.
For example:

- Arya (2021) defines it as “the taking of items (whether tangible or intangible) including ideas, from one culture by another.” (based on Young, 2010, p. 5)

- Ziff and Rao (1997) emphasize the lack of authorization, they describes it as “the taking from a culture that is not one’s own — of intellectual property, cultural expressions or artifacts, history and ways of knowledge.”

- And the Cambridge Dictionary puts it simply: “the act of taking or using things from a culture that is not your own, especially without showing that you understand or respect this culture”
So across all these definitions, one key word keeps coming up: taking.
And this is very important because another word that is often used instead is “borrowing”. (see Shugart, 1997, pp. 210–211)
The problem is that borrowing implies you intend to return what you took.
But when cultural elements are “borrowed,” they’re rarely returned — and often, their meaning gets changed or stripped away in the process.
So calling it “borrowing” really underplays the moral and cultural weight of what’s happening.
And that brings us back to Tom.
Tom didn’t mean to offend anyone — he just wanted his design to feel authentic.
But what he really did was take Buddhist symbols and concepts like karma, and even the Japanese word Zen, and repurpose them for his app — without understanding or crediting their cultural significance.
That’s exactly how cultural appropriation often happens in design.
Not through malicious intent — but through unaware taking.
And this unawareness is something that’s becoming more and more common, because globalization and the internet have made cultural exchange easier than ever — and at the same time, they’ve made appropriation easier than ever too.
(Arya 2021)
We have endless access to other cultures at our fingertips:
stock image libraries, mood boards on Pinterest, AI image generators — all potentially filled with visual and cultural material that can be copied, remixed, and reused in seconds.
So today cultural appropriation is something any of us can fall into without realizing it.
That’s what makes it such an urgent ethical question for UX designers.
However, Cultural Appropriation is not always as easy to define as in Tom’s case.
Let’s start with the word culture itself.
To say that someone “appropriated” something, we first have to assume that cultures are like fixed boxes — with clear boundaries, and with clear “insiders” and “outsiders.”But that’s not really how culture works.
As Arya (2021) points out, culture is amorphous — meaning shapeless, fluid, always changing.
Our identities overlap: someone might be an “insider” ethnically but an “outsider” socially or geographically.
So, when we say “you took from another culture,” the question becomes: which culture? whose boundaries? And who decides?That’s why these conversations can get complicated very fast.
Another reason it’s tricky is that “cultural appropriation” often gets mixed up with other forms of cultural wrongdoing.
Lennard and Balint (2020) identify two in particular: cultural offense and cultural misrepresentation.
Cultural offense is when an act or statement insults or hurts a group based on their culture.
This can be usualy be found in stereotypes, so we could talk from cultural offense when we create a user persona for a project and say …
Cultural misrepresentation, on the other hand, happens when a culture is shown in a false or oversimplified way.
Think of stereotypical Cinco de Mayo imagery — tacos, oversized sombreros, piñatas.
That’s not necessarily taking something from Mexican culture — it’s flattening it into a caricature.
So, while both of these are wrong, they’re not the same thing as cultural appropriation — which specifically involves taking something of value from another culture and making it one’s own.
Lennard and Balint (2020) suggest that for something to count as cultural appropriation, it needs to meet four conditions.
1. The Taking Condition — there has to be an act of taking: using a symbol, practice, or style that didn’t originate with you.
2. The Value Condition — what’s taken must actually matter to the culture it comes from. It’s not just a random aesthetic, but it holds meaning or importance.
3. The Contested Context Condition — members of that culture have to be voicing objection to the use, in a meaningful way. It’s not about one angry person on reddit but it’s about a shared sense of harm.
4. The Knowledge, or Culpable Ignorance Condition — and the person taking either knows it’s valuable and contested, or they should have known better. For example if they have access to internet and could easily research it, like in Tom’s case.
And if all four of these conditions are met — then we can say that an act is cultural appropriation, and that in that case, Lennard and Balint argue that it’s morally wrong.
So if we take a look at Tom’s case again, he ticks all of the boxes. 
- He took religious and cultural concepts (the taking condition),
- They held value in their original contexts,
- People from those cultures might contest his use of them,
- And his ignorance of their meanings was something he could have avoided.

Tom didn’t mean harm, it’s not about intent, but about awareness and responsibility.

So one of the main problems with cultural appropriation is that it often happens in contexts of unequal power — where one group has more social, economic, or historical privilege than the other.
So when people from a dominant culture take from a marginalized culture, the act isn’t neutral anymore — it reinforces the same imbalances that already exist.
Lennard and Balint (2020) describe this as an “amplifier” — meaning it makes the act of appropriation morally worse.
Arya (2021) also connects this to cultural imperialism — the way powerful cultures define what’s “cool,” “aesthetic,” or “authentic.”
In Tom’s example, he casually takes Buddhist and Hindu symbols — but he’s doing that from a position of privilege.
Another harm can be done through commodification, which means turning a cultural good into something that can be bought and sold. 
In this process, the cultural element’s use value — so that would be its meaning within the culture — is replaced by its exchange value — what it’s worth commercially.
Schneider (2003) calls this “stripping context” — taking a symbol or practice, removing it from its original meaning, and reusing it for a totally different goal — usually commercial.
And a final harm that can be done to the orginal culture is through a phenomenon called re-enculturation. (Arya 2021)
It’s when the dominant culture takes something, repackages it (by stripping it’s context), and then sells it back to the original culture
For Example:
1. Yoga and mindfulness have deep spiritual and philosophical roots in Indian traditions.
2. Western companies rebranded them as commercial wellness apps — so they feel very sleek but they are also stripped of spirituality.
3. These Westernized products were then sold globally — including back to India.

So people there start learning yoga through this Western lens — effectively re-learning their own culture as a branded product.
So all of the harms I mentioned so far fall on the culture being taken from. But it can also come back to those doing the taking — whether that’s a company, a brand, or even an individual designer.
Especially in cases of cultural appropriation in the fashion industry we can observe that through online social media platforms consumers can have a strong voice that can quickly turn accusations of cultural appropriation into widespread reputational crises for the brand. (Sádaba 2020)
And for those of us in small agencies or working independently, this can even affect our personal reputation and the trust of clients.
Then there’s also a less obvious layer of harm — to the users.
A 2014 (Vasalou et al. 2014) study on a children’s game about Día de los Muertos showed that even when designers tried to represent the culture authentically, children began to reproduce the rituals in shallow or distorted ways.
The researchers realized their ethical responsibility didn’t end with cultural accuracy — they also had to consider how users interpret and re-use those cultural elements.
So, appropriation can set off a chain of misunderstanding — from designer, to user, to the wider world.
So now that we know what harm cultural appropriation can do, we have to ask is it always wrong?
One of the clearest arguments for why cultural appropriation is morally wrong comes from the professor of philosophy Erich Matthes.

He explains that appropriation doesn’t happen in a vacuum — it happens within systems of power.
When someone from a dominant culture takes from a marginalized one, that act of “taking” actively reinforces inequality.
So, for Matthes, the wrongness isn’t about “hurt feelings” or about who owns what.
It’s wrong because it contributes to ongoing oppression — it adds to the marginalization the group already experiences.
In short: Cultural appropriation isn’t neutral; it’s political.
But not everyone agrees.
Some writers and philosophers argue that the current sensitivity around cultural appropriation has gone too far — that it risks stifling creativity.
One of the loudest voices is Lionel Shriver, who in a controversial speech argued that the backlash against cultural borrowing is a kind of “surveillance” — a way of policing imagination.
She believes writers — and by extension, designers and artists — must be able to imagine themselves in other people’s shoes.
If they’re too afraid of being accused of appropriation, she warns, we’ll end up with art and design that’s safe, bland, and lifeless.
Philosopher James O. Young makes a similar point.
He doesn’t see appropriation as inherently wrong — as long as the appropriator gives proper acknowledgment and approaches the material with respect.In his view, forbidding all cultural borrowing would restrict creativity, and prevent meaningful cultural exchange.
Before I continue to show you a possible way from appropriation to appreciation I want to start the discussion now; so I am curious to hear your opinion on these questions:
• “When does cultural inspiration cross the line into harmful appropriation?”
• “Do you think avoiding all cultural references limits creativity?”
• “What can we do as designers to stay inspired and respectful?”
So — after everything we’ve talked about — the question becomes:
What can we, as designers, actually do?
So in other words how can we stay inspired by cultures that are not our own, without repeating the same patterns of harm?
A simple way to start is by understanding the difference between appreciation and appropriation.
So, in Appreciation we seek to learn and understand the full context of an cultural elment while when appropriating we just take something as a snapshot with any context.
Appreciation is also focused on the real cultural value istead of the commercial exchange value.
Besides that, appreciation is really centered on participation, dialogue, and getting permission. This approach helps to decenter power. On the other hand, appropriation is fundamentally an unauthorized taking by a more dominant group.
Another key difference is that appreciation always credits the source culture, and if it's used commercially, it also involves compensation. While appropriation does the opposite; it often distorts or trivializes the culture it's taking from, stripping it of its original meaning.
And finally practicing appreciation requires a lot of intention. It asks us to be critical, reflective, and sensitive in our approach.
In contrast, appropriation is often done unintentionally — like in Tom’s case — but the key point being that it still causes real harm.
Before drawing from another culture, ask yourself three questions, and to make it easy to remember we can asign each of them to one of the Ps in the word appropriaiton.
the 3 P’s: Power, Profit, and Participation.
So as we already learned Cultural appropriation usually happens when a dominant culture takes from a marginalized one which can einforce existing inequalities.
So askyourself:
Am I, part of a culture that holds more power?
Am I taking inspiration from a group that has historically been silenced, colonized, or underrepresented?
If yes, this doesn’t mean that you can never engage and get inspiration from that culture, but it means you must move forward with carefully. 
Because with great power comes great responsibility.
Alright so the next P is Profit.
You should ask yourself: 
Am I using a cultural element for meaning or just for aesthetics?
If your answer is yes, you’re turning something sacred or symbolic into a product or decorative motif, you are stipping away it’s context and commodifying. 
So you should stop right there.
And for the final P that stands for Participation you can ask yourself:
Am I taking without permission, or am I co-creating? 
Who benefits from this work — me, or the people whose culture it represents?

The best path is collaboration.
You should involve people from that culture but not just as consultants, but as co-designers or decision-makers.
And finally I would like to end with something, which requres a deeper shift in the way we can think about appropriation.

The philosopher Schneider suggests a hermeneutic process, which is a way of interpreting and understanding, instead of just taking.

He says:
You have to first let go of your own assumptions, your ego, your habits — and allow yourself to truly learn from something that feels “other.”

When you do that, the process of engagement transforms you.
You no longer “take” something from another culture; instead, you grow through understanding it and you are less likely to harm anyone.
