**When does cultural inspiration cross the line into harmful appropriation?**
* If you ignore the opinions of the culture affected or borrowed from, then it becomes harmful. One has to acknowledge the privileges and inherent power that comes from being the “oppressor” (for lack of a better word) culture. You’re not celebrating a culture if you are refusing to hear a culture.
* On purpose, Representing a culture in a bad light, or mocking aspects of a culture or of a group of people. E.g., some brands used to have very racist and demeaning representations of black women as their logos or brand mascots.

**Do you think avoiding all cultural references limits creativity?**
* If you can’t design good experiences or a good product without appropriating or harming another culture, are you really a good designer?
* For me, the lack of creativity starts when a product is designed using for example clichés about the cultural origins of a product or an object (like stamping sombreros on anything remotely Mexican, or worse, on latinamerican products that have no connection to Mexico). Creativity cannot be limited if there was no creativity in the first place.

**What can we do as designers to stay inspired and respectful?**
* Involve people from the associated cultures, from the very beginning. Just some interviews in the explorative phase of a creative project may not be enough, bringing the people on board while developing and testing can help keep the design or product respectful, while still being high quality. And the people from those cultures are also creative and may even give you more ideas and offer new perspectives!
