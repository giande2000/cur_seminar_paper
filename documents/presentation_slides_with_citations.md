**Presenter:** G. Decaro

## Introduction: The Story of Tom (fictional)

**Tom**

* UXD Student
* **Project:** Design a Meditation App

**The Process:**

1. **Google Search:** Tom searches for "meditation origin".
* *Goal:* "I want to make it feel authentic."


2. **Image Selection:** Finds an image of a white Polyresin Thai Buddha.
* *Reaction:* "That's perfect for an app icon!"


3. **Pattern Selection:** Finds a "Japanese Buddhist Pattern" (Gold Yellow Blue Geometric Motifs).
* *Goal:* "A background with some spice."


4. **App Name:** Zenify
* *Rationale:* "Everyone knows Zen."


5. **Gamification:** Adds "Karma Points +52".
* *Rationale:* "Karma Points as gamification."


6. **Monetization:** Subscription screen "Find your Nirvana - monthly $9.99".
* *Rationale:* "Let's make some money."



**The Result:**

* **App Icon:** Silhouette of the Buddha.
* **Background:** Japanese geometric pattern.
* **Feature:** Karma Points.
* **Subscription:** "Find your Nirvana" for $9.99.

**Key Question:**

> When does cultural inspiration become cultural appropriation?

## Part 1: What Is Cultural Appropriation?

### Definitions

**Etymology:**

* **lat. *appropriare*:** "to make ones own" (Ashley & Plesch, 2002; Schneider, 2003).

**Academic & Dictionary Definitions:**

* "The taking of items (whether tangible or intangible) including ideas, from one culture by another." — (Arya, 2021; based on Young, 2010).
* "The taking from a culture that is not one's own - of intellectual property, cultural expressions or artifacts, history and ways of knowledge." — (Ziff & Rao, 1997).
* "The act of taking or using things from a culture that is not your own, especially without showing that you understand or respect this culture." — (Cambridge Dictionary, 2025).

**Key Distinction:**

* Borrowing  Taking.

### Urgency of Appropriation
* Globalization and the internet have made cultural exchange easier than ever.
* However, they have made appropriation easier than ever too (Arya, 2021).

### Why It Is Hard to Define

**1. Amorphous Cultures** (Arya, 2021)
* *Visual Concept:* Cultures are not rigid boxes (Culture A vs. Culture B); they are fluid with blurred lines.

**2. Distinguishing Concepts** (Lenard & Balint, 2020)

* **Cultural Offense:** Acts or statements that insult or humiliate others on the basis of their cultural membership. (Lenard & Balint, 2020)
* **Cultural Misrepresentation:** The problematic representation of cultural actions and those who practice them, often in false and misleading ways. (Lenard & Balint, 2020)
* **Cultural Appropriation:** (See conditions below).

### Conditions of Cultural Appropriation

According to (Lenard & Balint, 2020), for an act to be considered Cultural Appropriation, it typically meets these conditions:

1. **Taking Condition:** Someone takes something.
2. **+ Value Condition:** The item has value.
3. **+ Contested Context Condition:** The context is disputed.
4. **+ Knowledge or Culpable Ignorance Condition:** The taker knows, or should have known.
5. **= Cultural Appropriation.**
* *Question:* Is it morally wrong?


---

## Part 2: The Harm It Causes

### 1. Unequal Power

* (Arya, 2021; Lenard & Balint, 2020)
* **Dynamic:** The **Dominant Culture** takes from the **Marginalized Culture**.
* This taking happens within a context of historical or systemic power imbalances.

### 2. Commodification

* "The process by which a culture, in any or all of its aspects, is turned into an object of sale." — (Arya, 2021).
* **The Transformation Process:**
1. **Cultural Element:** Has **Use Value** (What the item *is* and *means* within its culture) (Arya, 2021).
2. **"Stripping Context"** (Schneider, 2003).
3. **Commercial Product:** Has **Exchange Value** (What the item is *worth* commercially when it's sold as a product) (Arya, 2021).



### 3. Re-enculturation (The Cycle of Harm) 

(Arya, 2021)
* **Step 1:** Cultural Element exists in the Marginalized Culture.
* **Step 2 (Appropriation):** Dominant Culture takes the element.
* **Step 3 (Commodification):** The element is turned into a **Repackaged Element**.
* **Step 4 (Re-enculturation):** The repackaged, commodified product is sold back to the Marginalized Culture.

### Summary of Harms and Consequences

**Origin Culture**

* Power imbalance.
* Loss of meaning and context.
* Exploitation without credit or benefit.
* Distortion of own culture.

**Designers and Brands (Appropriators)** (Sádaba and Torres, 2020)

* Reputational risk (backlash, cancel culture, loss of trust).
* Loss of authenticity.

**Users/Consumers** (Vasalou et al., 2014)

* Shallow understanding of the represented culture.
* Spread of stereotypes through re-use and imitation.
* Cultural desensitization (normalizing misrepresentation).
* Ethical confusion ("If it's in the product, it must be okay").

## Part 3: Is It Always Wrong? (Ethical Perspectives)

**Perspective A: The Oppression View**

* **Erich Matthes** (Matthes, 2019):
* "The wrong of cultural appropriation is rooted in imbalances of power."
* "[...] what makes cultural appropriation wrong [...] is the way it interacts with the oppression of certain cultural group members."



**Perspective B: The Respectful Exchange View**

* **James O. Young** (Young, 2010):
* Appropriation is not inherently wrong, *if* proper acknowledgment is given and the material is approached with respect.
* Argues that forbidding all cultural borrowing would restrict creativity and prevent meaningful cultural exchange.



**Perspective C: The Artistic Freedom View**

* **Lionel Shriver** (Shriver, 2016):
* Argues that a writer's entire enterprise is to "step into other people's shoes."
* "I am hopeful that the concept of 'cultural appropriation' is a passing fad."
* Views criticism of appropriation as "surveillance" that polices imagination.



### Open Discussion

* When does cultural inspiration cross the line into harmful appropriation?
* Do you think avoiding all cultural references limits creativity?
* What can we do as designers to stay inspired *and* respectful?

## Part 4: From Appropriation to Appreciation

What can we, as designers, actually do?

### Appropriation vs. Appreciation

| Appreciation (Responsible Sharing) | Appropriation (Harmful Taking) |
| --- | --- |
| Seeks to learn and understand the full **context** and history. | Takes something as a "snapshot", ignoring its "social history" (Arya, 2021). |
| Focuses on the **"real value"**, meaning, spirit, and history. | Focuses on **"exchange value"**, the aesthetic or commercial worth (Arya, 2021). |
| Is centered on **participation**, dialogue, and permission: it decenters power. | Is an **unauthorized taking** by a dominant group (Arya, 2021). |
| **Credits** and (if commercial) **compensates** the source culture. | Distorts or trivializes the source culture (Arya, 2021). |
| Requires designers to be critical, reflective, and sensitive. | Often done unintentionally but still causes harm (Arya, 2021). |

### The 3 P's Framework

*Adapted from a framework by (Kawasaki, 2022)*

**1. POWER — What's the context?**

* *Question:* Am I part of a culture that holds more power?
* *Question:* Am I taking inspiration from a group that has historically been silenced, colonized, or underrepresented?
* *Result:* If yes: **Move forward with care.**
* *Quote:* "With great power comes great responsibility..."

**2. PROFIT — Am I commodifying or trivializing?**

* *Question:* Am I using a cultural element simply for aesthetics or to add "some spice"?
* *Result:* If yes: **STOP!**

**3. PARTICIPATION — Who is involved and who benefits?**

* *Question:* Am I taking without permission, or am I co-creating?
* *Question:* Who benefits from this work—me, or the people whose culture it represents?
* *Action:* **Choose collaboration.** Share credit. Share profit. Share ownership.

### The Hermeneutic Procedure

*(Schneider, 2003)*

This is a deep process of "learning" and "understanding" something that is "alien" or "other" to you.

**The Cycle:**

1. **Relinquishes Ego:** The Appropriator lets go of their own preconceptions.
2. **Learns and Understands:** The Appropriator engages with **The "Other"**.
3. **Transforms the Appropriator:** This leads to a **New Self-Understanding**.
