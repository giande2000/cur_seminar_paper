# Key-Points (Vasalou et al. 2014)

### Co-Existence of Cultural Authenticity and Appropriation

**Authenticity and appropriation are not mutually exclusive**; we found they co-exist.

- **Cultural Authenticity:** We argue that game narratives *can* communicate cultural authenticity, even with a narrow focus. By foregrounding the core values (remembrance, acceptance) and symbolic rituals of Dia de los Muertos, most of the children successfully understood and "enacted" the festival's intended message.
- **Cultural Appropriation:** At the same time, appropriation was **"hard to avoid" and "inevitable"**. The children naturally sought to make the unfamiliar experiences "more familiar". They did this by filtering the festival's themes through their own cultural, social, and religious backgrounds.

### Ethical Obligations for Designers

The harm was not that the children were *damaging* the Mexican culture, but that the design (our game) was surfacing these "problematic"  beliefs without a framework to address them. We, as designers, had an **ethical obligation** to handle this clash between the authentic cultural message and the children's "destructive" interpretations with sensitivity.

Our most central point is that our findings **broadened our ethical obligations**. Our concern shifted from *just* the originating culture to include a new responsibility for the *end users* (the children).

**We were initially motivated by an ethical duty to the originating (Mexican) culture. However, the children's own appropriation of the festival raised new ethical issues.** Their stories revealed:

- A belief that death primarily affects "people of status", which contradicts the festival's message of universality.
- "Counterproductive and detrimental ways of coping with death, including revenge and the suppression of emotions".

This meant that striving for cultural authenticity forced us to confront our users' existing, and sometimes problematic, beliefs**. Our ethical duty expanded to include handling this "clash" with sensitivity.**

**Appropriation Raises New Ethics About the *User***: Our primary argument is that the designer's ethical responsibility **extends beyond the originating culture to include the end-user**.

### The UX Challange

**The UX Challenge is Managing the "Clash"**

For designers, the critical challenge isn't just "how to be authentic." It's how to **sensitively handle the clash** that happens when your authentic cultural narrative meets the user's existing, and potentially conflicting, beliefs.

### Rethinking Co-Design/Participatory Design

You can't just "ask your users." If we had only used the children's ideas, we would have simply reinforced their own cultural appropriations. We argue for participatory methods that first **develop the user's cultural knowledge** or **involve cultural experts** to work alongside users.
