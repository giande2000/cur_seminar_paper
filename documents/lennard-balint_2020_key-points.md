# Key-Points (Lennard & Balint 2020)

### Two views on Cultural Appropriation  (clusters of responses)

### 1. The "Sceptical" View

This group is generally **sceptical** of claims of cultural appropriation.

- They argue that cultures **always borrow from each other** and that this is a normal, healthy part of human interaction.
- They often point to the **benefits** of this exchange, like new forms of music or a "rich" national culture.
- Many in this group dismiss the accusations as **"the worst form of political correctness"** or harmful "identity politics" that distract from "real" issues like economic inequality.

### 2. The "Sympathetic" View

This group is **sympathetic** to the idea that there is "something morally troubling" about cultural appropriation.

- They tend to treat cultural appropriation as **"theft"**—the taking of something valuable that belongs to others.
- They see it as an issue of **"power"**, where privileged individuals from dominant groups take from marginalized groups.
- For this group, the act is often part of a **"long-standing history"** in which those with less power are treated with contempt.

There are **two main voices** in this group:

- One voice expresses a "reluctance to engage in cultural practices that 'belong' to others, because doing so **feels weird or uncomfortable** in some way".
- A second, related voice "worries that engaging in the cultural practices of others is somehow **inauthentic** and so objectionable". The example we give for this is the objection to Westerners practicing yoga for a workout, or people wearing Native American headdresses without having earned the right.

### What is not Cultural Appropriation

There are at least **two** other potentially **negative forms of cultural exchange that are sometimes mistakenly called ‘cultural appropriation’.**

The point of describing these two prevalent forms of potentially wrongful cultural engagement is to distinguish them from their more famous cousin, ‘cultural appropriation’.

### **Cultural Offense**

- A specifically cultural offence is one that causes others to be upset or hurt, by acting in a way that attacks or insults others’ cultural practices or beliefs, or by acting in a way that attacks or insults people based on their cultural practices or beliefs.
- While some, if not most, acts of cultural appropriation generate cultural offence, not all cultural offence is cultural appropriation. Cultural offence is not defined by the taking or using another’s cultural practices or symbols.
- **Cultural offences are acts or statements that insult or humiliate others on the basis of their cultural membership.**
- **Example:** We mention an Italian fashion brand, Miu Miu, that sold a dress "featuring a five-pointed yellow star with the name 'John' through the centre". This caused offense because many Jews and allies "objected to this design, accusing it of being reminiscent of the six-pointed yellow star... that the Nazis ordered Jews to wear for identification purposes". This is a clear case of cultural offense because the design, intentionally or not, "attacks or insults" a group based on their cultural identity and painful history.

### Cultural Misinterpretation

- Misrepresentation is generally an act or statement that gives a false or misleading account of something; correspondingly, cultural misrepresentation refers to acts or statements that provide a false or misleading depiction of practices or beliefs.
- Perhaps the most common form of cultural misrepresentation is stereotyping. To engage in cultural stereotyping is to present an oversimplified version of a culture in ways that treat cultural groups as homogenous.
- **cultural misrepresentation requires the problematic representation of cultural actions and those who practice them, often in false and misleading ways.**
- **Example:** Criticisms of how Cinco de Mayo is celebrated, where "Mexican culture cannot be reduced to tacos, oversized sombreros and piñatas". This is a form of stereotyping that gives a "false or misleading account" of the culture.

### Types Cultural Appropriation (Content Appropiation)

### Conditions of Cultural Appropriation

1. **The taking condition**
    
    the idea, style or practice did not originate with the appropriator
    
2. **The value condition**
    
    The thing being taken needs be of value to those it is taken from, and this value needs to be claimed in some way.
    
    Five criterion to tell if the thing taken has value:
    
    1. a valuable cultural symbol or practice is ordinarily central to the culture’s collective life in some way
    2. a valuable cultural symbol or practice is ordinarily **recognizable** as such by its membership, or a large number of its members
    3. a valuable cultural symbol or practice has value to a significant number of its members
    4. (recommends to) amplify the voices of those who are most affected within the culture over those who may have more relative power
    5. whether the practice or symbol has only historical or also contemporary use
3. **The contested condition**
    
    Man, idk
    
4. **The knowledge condition**
    
    cultural appropriation is an act knowingly conducted by an appropriator, i.e., it is the deliberate use of a cultural practice or symbol from others and adopting it as one’s own, where this use is contested, and where one knows that the practice or symbol is central to the culture of others.
    
5. **The culpable ignorance condition**
    
    would you be able to know you are engaging in appropriation?
