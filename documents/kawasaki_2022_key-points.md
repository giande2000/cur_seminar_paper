### The 3 P's of Cultural Appropriation

A survival toolkit, called the three Ps of cultural appropriation, to help identify and address cultural appropriation.

1. The first P, cultural property, refers to the essential elements that help identify a culture, such as dreadlocks in African culture. It’s not about origin, ownership, or history. It’s about having an awareness for elements that are part of an culture.
2. The second P, privilege, refers to the power and societal benefits that come with being part of the dominant culture. “With great power and priviledge comes great responsibility”
3. The third P, profit, Profit is a key aspect of cultural appropriation, where people make money from appropriating and exploiting other cultures, often without giving back to the communities they are profiting from
