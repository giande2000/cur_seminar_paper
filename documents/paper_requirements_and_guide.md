2. Outline and structure your paper
3. Start writing

### **Tipps and tricks**

## Chapters

### **Introduction (clear, concise and informative)**

1. **Start with a clear statement**: what do you want to argue for (can also be a question)
→ think about what theories support or weaken your argument
2. Provide the reader with some **context**: why is this topic important?
    
3. Let the reader know how your argument is structured/**how you will address the
research question**; this helps them follow how the arguments contribute to the
conclusion.

**Guiding Questions**

- Is my introduction short and clear?
- Does it contain a clear statement of my main thesis?
- Does it provide a brief overview of my main arguments?
- Does it explain the general structure of my essay?
</aside>

### **Main Part (Arguments)**

1. **Develop Arguments**
    - What are the premises (assumptions) for your argument? A specific theory/concept?
    - Outline your argument logically based on the premises → each premise needs to be clearly stated and carefully explained
    - Make sure to work with the existing literature and CITE accordingly
    - Recommendation: use individual paragraphs for individual premises
2. **What Counterarguments Exist?**
    - Name them and, if necessary, briefly discuss them (or alternatively: explain why you are not addressing them).
    - Why does your argument remain strong?

<aside>

**Guiding Questions**

- Have I presented my arguments in such a way that they provide reasons
for accepting my thesis as true?
- Have I stated all my premises clearly and unambiguously?
- Have I developed my argument completely and in detail so that my line of
reasoning is understandable to the reader?
</aside>

### Conclusion

1. The conclusion should **serve as a recap** for the reader: 
    - what was the initial statement or question, what was your argument (based on what premises?), and what is your conclusion?
    → see: red thread!
2. Do not introduce any new arguments here.
3. Conclusion can be used to **highlight gaps** in your argumentation and, if necessary,
provide an **outlook**.

<aside>

**Guiding Questions**

- What did you want to show in your essay? What was the starting point
and what conclusion did your argumentation lead to?
- In a nutshell: how did your most important arguments lead to this
conclusion?
- If applicable: where might your argumentation have weaknesses or gaps?
Did you leave questions open?

## Essay Examples

### Critical Analysis

**Approach Aim: convince reader of your critical point**

1. Read the target article
2. Identify target article’s argument you would like to challenge
3. Summarise the target article’s argument
4. State your challenge for the target article’s argument in the form of a thesis
5. Justify your thesis by an argument: use reasoning and/or evidence (work with other
literature/news paper articles, etc.)
6. Evaluate the extent to which your critical point poses a problem for the targeted argument or limits its scope or force
7. Put the draft aside for some time, re-read it, and refine it. Try to repeat this multiple times

**Paper Aim: show that your thesis is true/acceptable by providing reasons that support it**

1. **Introduction**: let your reader know that this is a critical analysis and what it’s about
    - What is the target text (title, author, date)
    - What is the target text‘s argument that you want to challenge? State it and explain briefly
    - What is your own critical point: thesis statement
2. **Main part**
    - Short summary of target text
    - Argument in support of your critical point/idea/thesis
        
        → Premises of argument plus extra literature/evidence that supports them
        
        → State premises clearly and explain them
        
    - Summarise and evaluate your argument and explain how it addresses the challenge
3. **Conclusion**

### **Defend Philosophical Thesis**

**Approach Aim: convince reader of your critical point**

1. Select a topic and narrow it down to a specific issue
2. Research the issue
3. Create an outline

5. Write a first draft
6. Study and revise your draft
