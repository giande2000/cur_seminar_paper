# Key-Points (Schneider 2003)

### **Appropriation as Hermeneutic Procedure (Understanding)**

I suggest we must move beyond seeing appropriation as just "taking" and instead understand it as a **hermeneutic procedure**—an act of interpretation and understanding. 

- **It's NOT:** Just "stealing" or "taking possession" of something.
- **It IS:** A deep process of **"learning"** and **"understanding"** something that is "alien" or "other" to you.
- **The Key Step:** You must first **"let go"** of your own ego, habits, and assumptions. The paper calls this "relinquishment".
- **The Result:** This process of learning **transforms you** and gives you a "new self-understanding". You "make it your own" by truly understanding it, not just by grabbing it.

### Stripping Context (The Harm)

**"Stripping Context":** This is where the ethical failure often happens. A design team might "appropriate" a symbol, color, or social metaphor from a culture. But in the process, they do what Marcus and Myers describe as "stripping cultural materials of their original context". The element is "assimilated" into the product, but its original meaning is lost, flattened, or repurposed—often for a commercial goal that is alien to the original context.

### Alienation (The Harmful Outcome)

When appropriation happens within an unequal power dynamic and *without* the deep hermeneutic "understanding," the result is **alienation**.

- **What Alienation Feels Like in UX:** For the user, this is the moment the product feels "wrong," disrespectful, or even manipulative. They see their cultural symbols used superficially, incorrectly, or in a commercial way that feels like a violation.
- **Example:** Imagine a "community" feature in an app that uses a sacred indigenous symbol as its icon. While the designer may have seen this as "honoring" the culture (a flawed form of "appropriation"), the users from that culture experience it as alienation. Their "cultural autonomy"—the right to determine how their own traditions are used—has been violated.
- **The "Savage Hits Back":** As I note in the paper, this can also lead to resistance. In UX terms, this might be users rejecting the product, mocking it on social media, or creating workarounds that "subvert" the designer's intended meaning —re-appropriating the product for their own ends.

### UX Designers as the “Interface” **(Individual Agency)**

As a UX designer, you are an **"interface"**. You are a "nodal point"  mediating between the power of a global corporation and the cultural realities of diverse users.

Your critical reflection should focus on:

- Is my research an act of genuine, hermeneutic "learning" or just a superficial "taking"?
- Am I acknowledging the power imbalance between my company and this user group?
- By "appropriating" this symbol, am I creating "understanding" or am I causing "alienation" by stripping it of its context?

Your ethical challenge is to pursue that hermeneutic "understanding" while actively fighting against the alienating effects of the power imbalance you operate within.
