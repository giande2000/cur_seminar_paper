# Seminar Paper Proposal: Cultural Appropriation in UX Design

## 1. Research Question

**Primary Research Question:**
*How can user experience (UX) designers ethically navigate the tension between cross-cultural inspiration and cultural appropriation to avoid perpetuating systemic oppression and commodification?*

**Sub-questions:**
1.  What distinguishes harmful cultural appropriation from respectful cultural appreciation or exchange within the specific context of digital product design?
2.  How do standard UX practices (like persona creation and aesthetic borrowing) risk reinforcing cultural stereotypes and power imbalances?
3.  What practical frameworks can be applied to transform the design process from one of "taking" to one of "hermeneutic understanding" and participation?

## 2. Proposed Structure & Outline

**Target Word Count:** ~3,500 - 4,000 words

### I. Introduction (approx. 400 words)
*   **Hook:** Open with the vignette of "Tom" (from your presentation) or a similar realistic scenario of a designer creating a "Zen" or "Indigenous-inspired" app. This grounds the abstract theory in a concrete UX reality.
*   **Context:** Discuss the impact of globalization and the internet. Cite **Arya (2021)** on how digital ease increases the "urgency" of the appropriation issue.
*   **Problem Statement:** UX design operates in a fast-paced, commercial environment often driven by aesthetics ("spice") and simplified user models. This creates a high risk for "unaware taking" that reinforces oppression.
*   **Thesis Statement:** While cultural inspiration is a vital part of creativity, without a critical understanding of power dynamics and context, it risks becoming harmful appropriation. UX designers must move beyond superficial "borrowing" toward a **hermeneutic process of understanding** (Schneider) and **participatory design** to ensure ethical engagement.
*   **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the progression of the paper (Definitions -> Ethical Framework -> UX Context -> Solutions -> Reflection).

### II. Defining the Terrain: Culture, Appropriation, and the "Fuzzy" Box (approx. 600 words)
*   **Defining Cultural Appropriation:**
    *   Move beyond the dictionary definition. Use **Arya (2021)** and **Young (2010)** to define it as "taking" (tangible/intangible) by a dominant culture from a marginalized one.
    *   Elaborate on the "Conditions of Appropriation" from **Lenard & Balint (2020)**: *The Taking Condition*, *The Value Condition*, *The Contested Context Condition*, and *The Knowledge/Culpable Ignorance Condition*.
*   **The Problem of "Culture":**
    *   Challenge the idea of cultures as fixed "boxes." Use **Arya (2021)** to explain culture as "amorphous" and "precarious."
    *   Explain why this "fuzziness" makes defining appropriation hard but necessary.
*   **Distinctions (What it is NOT):**
    *   Briefly distinguish Appropriation from *Cultural Exchange* (equal power), *Assimilation* (survival mechanism), *Cultural Offense*, and *Misrepresentation* (Lenard & Balint, 2020).

### III. The Ethics of "Taking": Harm, Power, and Commodification (approx. 800 words)
*   **The Oppression Account:**
    *   Use **Matthes (2019)** to provide the moral backbone: Appropriation is wrong because it interacts with and exacerbates *oppression*, not just because it offends. It is a political act.
*   **Commodification & Stripping Context:**
    *   Discuss how design often reduces "Use Value" (cultural meaning) to "Exchange Value" (commercial worth) (**Arya, 2021**).
    *   Cite **Schneider (2003)** on "stripping context"—removing the symbol from its web of meaning.
    *   **The Pizza Effect (Re-enculturation):** Explain **Arya’s (2021)** concept. Use the example of Western-designed Yoga/Wellness apps being sold back to the East. This is a crucial "Critical UX" insight—how design influences the source culture.
*   **Counter-Arguments (Critical Reflection):**
    *   Present the "Sceptical View" (**Lennard & Balint, 2020**) and the "Artistic Freedom" argument (**Lionel Shriver**). Acknowledge the fear of "policing imagination."
    *   *Rebuttal:* Argue why Commercial UX Design differs from pure Fiction/Art. The *profit* motive and *functional* nature of UX make the "oppression account" more relevant than the "freedom" account.

### IV. Cultural Appropriation in UX Practice (approx. 700 words)
*   **Visual & UI Design:**
    *   Discuss the "Spice" analogy (**bell hooks** via Arya): Using religious icons (Buddha) or patterns (Indigenous) purely for aesthetic "vibes" in an app.
*   **UX Research & Personas:**
    *   Analyze how **User Personas** can act as "Essentialist Boxes." By defining "The Gen Z User" or "The Hispanic User," designers risk stereotyping and ignoring the "interlocking identities" (intersectionality) mentioned by **Arya**.
*   **The User vs. The Source:**
    *   Introduce **Vasalou et al. (2014)**: The tension between *Cultural Authenticity* (faithfulness to source) and *User Appropriation* (how users interpret it).
    *   Case Study: The Día de los Muertos game. Discuss the "clash" between authentic representation and user interpretation.
    *   Argument: Designers have an expanded ethical obligation to both the *source culture* AND the *end user*.

### V. From Appropriation to Appreciation: A Framework for Designers (approx. 600 words)
*   **The 3 Ps Framework:**
    *   Synthesize the findings into the practical "3 Ps" model (adapted from **Kawasaki, 2022** and your presentation):
        1.  **Power:** Checking privilege and historical context.
        2.  **Profit:** Is this for commercial gain vs. cultural sustenance?
        3.  **Participation:** Who is involved? (Han, 2019).
*   **The Hermeneutic Procedure:**
    *   Deepen the solution using **Schneider (2003)**.
    *   Contrast "Taking" (appropriation) with "Understanding" (hermeneutics).
    *   Explain that true appreciation requires "relinquishing ego" and allowing the "other" to transform the designer's self-understanding.
*   **Participatory Design:**
    *   Propose *Co-design* as the methodological fix (Vasalou et al., 2014). Involve source communities as *partners*, not just research subjects.

### VI. Reflection on Interactive Class Activity (approx. 400 words)
*   *Note: Since the specific results of the activity aren't in the notes, use this section to reflect on the discussion points you planned.*
*   **Activity Description:** Briefly describe the discussion questions you posed (e.g., "Does avoiding all cultural references limit creativity?").
*   **Reflection on Peer Feedback:**
    *   Did the class struggle to draw the line between inspiration and appropriation?
    *   Did they lean more towards "Shriver's artistic freedom" or "Matthes's oppression account"?
    *   **Insight:** Reflect on how difficult it is for designers to accept constraints on creativity, but how the "3 Ps" helped clarify the ethical boundary.

### VII. Conclusion (approx. 300 words)
*   **Recap:** Summarize that appropriation is a structural issue, not just an individual intention.
*   **Answer RQ:** Ethical navigation requires moving from *aesthetic borrowing* (stripping context) to *participatory understanding* (hermeneutics).
*   **Outlook:** A call for "Critical UX"—designers must act as "interfaces" (Schneider) who mediate cultures responsibly.

## 3. Tips for Writing (from your Guide)
*   **Red Thread:** Ensure the definition of "Power" links every chapter. The transition from *defining* the harm (Ch III) to *seeing* it in UX (Ch IV) to *solving* it (Ch V) is your narrative arc.
*   **Definitions:** When you introduce "Commodification," "Hermeneutics," or "Re-enculturation," define them immediately.
*   **Citation Strategy:**
    *   Use **Arya** for the broad definitions and the "Pizza Effect."
    *   Use **Matthes** for the ethical argument (oppression).
    *   Use **Schneider** for the solution (hermeneutics) and the concept of "stripping context."
    *   Use **Vasalou et al.** for the specific UX/Game design application.
    *   Use **Han** and **Kawasaki** for the practical frameworks (Appreciation vs. Appropriation, 3 Ps).
