# Seminar Paper Proposal: Cultural Appropriation in UX Design

## 1. Research Question

**Primary Research Question:**
*How can user experience (UX) designers ethically navigate the tension between cross-cultural inspiration and cultural appropriation to avoid perpetuating systemic oppression and commodification?*

**Sub-questions:**
1.  What distinguishes harmful cultural appropriation from respectful cultural appreciation or exchange within the specific context of digital product design?
2.  How do standard UX practices (like persona creation and aesthetic borrowing) risk reinforcing cultural stereotypes and power imbalances?
3.  What practical frameworks can be applied to transform the design process from one of "taking" to one of "hermeneutic understanding" and participation?

## 2. Proposed Structure & Outline

**Target Word Count:** ~3,500 - 4,000 words

### I. Introduction (approx. 400 words)
*   **Hook:** Open with the vignette of "Tom" (from your presentation) or a similar realistic scenario of a designer creating a "Zen" or "Indigenous-inspired" app. This grounds the abstract theory in a concrete UX reality.
*   **Context:** Discuss the impact of globalization and the internet. Cite **Arya (2021)** on how digital ease increases the "urgency" of the appropriation issue.
*   **Problem Statement:** UX design operates in a fast-paced, commercial environment often driven by aesthetics ("spice") and simplified user models. This creates a high risk for "unaware taking" that reinforces oppression.
*   **Research Question:** Explicitly state the central question guiding the inquiry: *How can user experience (UX) designers ethically navigate the tension between cross-cultural inspiration and cultural appropriation to avoid perpetuating systemic oppression and commodification?*
*   **Thesis Statement:** While cultural inspiration is a vital part of creativity, without a critical understanding of power dynamics and context, it risks becoming harmful appropriation. UX designers must move beyond superficial "borrowing" toward a **hermeneutic process of understanding** (Schneider) and **participatory design** to ensure ethical engagement.
*   **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the progression of the paper (Definitions -> Ethical Framework -> UX Context -> Solutions -> Reflection).

### II. Defining the Terrain: Culture, Appropriation, and the "Fuzzy" Box (approx. 600 words)
*   **Defining Cultural Appropriation:**
    *   Move beyond the dictionary definition. Use **Arya (2021)** and **Young (2010)** to define it as "taking" (tangible/intangible) by a dominant culture from a marginalized one.
    *   Elaborate on the "Conditions of Appropriation" from **Lenard & Balint (2020)**: *The Taking Condition*, *The Value Condition*, *The Contested Context Condition*, and *The Knowledge/Culpable Ignorance Condition*.
*   **The Problem of "Culture":**
    *   Challenge the idea of cultures as fixed "boxes." Use **Arya (2021)** to explain culture as "amorphous" and "precarious."
    *   Explain why this "fuzziness" makes defining appropriation hard but necessary.
*   **Distinctions (What it is NOT):**
    *   Briefly distinguish Appropriation from *Cultural Exchange* (equal power), *Assimilation* (survival mechanism), *Cultural Offense*, and *Misrepresentation* (Lenard & Balint, 2020).

### III. The Ethics of "Taking": Harm, Power, and Commodification (approx. 800 words)
*   **The Oppression Account:**
    *   Use **Matthes (2019)** to provide the moral backbone: Appropriation is wrong because it interacts with and exacerbates *oppression*, not just because it offends. It is a political act.
*   **Commodification & Stripping Context:**
    *   Discuss how design often reduces "Use Value" (cultural meaning) to "Exchange Value" (commercial worth) (**Arya, 2021**).
    *   Cite **Schneider (2003)** on "stripping context"—removing the symbol from its web of meaning.
    *   **The Pizza Effect (Re-enculturation):** Explain **Arya’s (2021)** concept. Use the example of Western-designed Yoga/Wellness apps being sold back to the East. This is a crucial "Critical UX" insight—how design influences the source culture.
*   **Counter-Arguments (Critical Reflection):**
    *   **The Sceptical View:** Briefly mention the view that cultures always borrow (Lennard & Balint, 2020).
    *   **The "Respectful Exchange" View (Young, 2010):** Introduce James O. Young’s philosophical argument that appropriation is not *inherently* wrong if proper acknowledgment is given. Use this to nuance the debate: unlike Shriver, he values respect, but like her, he warns that forbidding all borrowing "curtails creativity."
    *   **The "Artistic Freedom" View (Shriver):** Contrast Young's academic stance with Shriver’s more aggressive argument against "policing imagination."
    *   *Rebuttal:* Argue why Commercial UX Design differs from pure Fiction/Art. The *profit* motive and *functional* nature of UX make the "oppression account" (Matthes) more relevant than the "freedom" account.

### IV. Cultural Appropriation in UX Practice (approx. 700 words)
*   **Visual & UI Design:**
    *   Discuss the "Spice" analogy (**bell hooks** via Arya): Using religious icons (Buddha) or patterns (Indigenous) purely for aesthetic "vibes" in an app.
*   **UX Research & Personas:**
    *   Analyze how **User Personas** can act as "Essentialist Boxes." By defining "The Gen Z User" or "The Hispanic User," designers risk stereotyping and ignoring the "interlocking identities" (intersectionality) mentioned by **Arya**.
*   **The User vs. The Source:**
    *   Introduce **Vasalou et al. (2014)**: The tension between *Cultural Authenticity* (faithfulness to source) and *User Appropriation* (how users interpret it).
    *   Case Study: The Día de los Muertos game. Discuss the "clash" between authentic representation and user interpretation.
    *   Argument: Designers have an expanded ethical obligation to both the *source culture* AND the *end user*.

### V. From Appropriation to Appreciation: A Framework for Designers (approx. 600 words)
*   **Defining the Goal: Appreciation vs. Appropriation:**
    *   Use **Arya (2021)** and **Han (2019)** to distinguish the two. Define **Appreciation** not just as "liking" a culture, but as an active engagement that seeks *context*, honors *use value* (meaning), and involves *dialogue*. Contrast this with Appropriation (snapshot, exchange value, unauthorized taking).
*   **The Practical Tool: The 3 Ps Framework:**
    *   Introduce the "3 Ps" (adapted from **Kawasaki**) as the diagnostic tool designers can use to ensure they are practicing *Appreciation* rather than *Appropriation*:
        1.  **Power:** Checking privilege. (Ensures the exchange isn't reinforcing oppression—refer back to Matthes).
        2.  **Profit:** Checking the motive. (Ensures "Use Value" isn't stripped for "Exchange Value"—refer back to Arya/Commodifiction).
        3.  **Participation:** Checking the agency. (Ensures "Dialogue"—refer back to Han).
*   **The Method: Hermeneutics & Co-Design:**
    *   Deepen the "Participation" aspect using **Schneider (2003)** and **Vasalou et al. (2014)**.
    *   Argue that the only way to truly satisfy the "Participation" and "Power" checks is through **Participatory Design** (Co-design).
    *   Explain **Schneider’s "Hermeneutic Procedure"**: This is the mindset shift from "taking" (ego-centric) to "understanding" (relinquishing ego) that makes ethical co-design possible.

### VI. Reflection on Interactive Class Activity: Validating the Framework (approx. 400 words)
*   **Context:** Frame the class discussion as a "reality check" for the theoretical arguments. Did the tensions identified in the literature (Shriver vs. Matthes) play out in a room of actual designers?
*   **Theme 1: Rebutting the "Creativity Constraint" (Refuting Shriver):**
    *   *The Debate:* Address the "Artistic Freedom" counter-argument (Ch. III).
    *   *Student Insight:* One student effectively challenged Shriver’s fear of restriction by asking: *"If you can’t design good experiences... without appropriating or harming another culture, are you really a good designer?"*
    *   *Analysis:* Use this to **validate** the rejection of the "Artistic Freedom" view. The class argued that relying on stereotypes (e.g., "stamping sombreros") represents a *lack* of creativity. This confirms that ethical constraints act as quality control, not censorship.
*   **Theme 2: Power and "Refusing to Hear":**
    *   *Student Insight:* The discussion highlighted that *"You’re not celebrating a culture if you are refusing to hear a culture,"* and emphasized acknowledging the role of the "oppressor" culture.
    *   *Analysis:* This confirms the practical relevance of **Matthes's Oppression Account** (Ch. III). The students' intuition aligned with the theoretical definition of harm, reinforcing that designers are aware of the power dynamics inherent in their work.
*   **Theme 3: The Consensus on Co-Design:**
    *   *Student Insight:* Students argued that *"Just some interviews... may not be enough"* and suggested *"bringing the people on board while developing."*
    *   *Validation of Solution:* This serves as empirical support for the **Participatory Design** solution proposed in Chapter V. The fact that peers independently arrived at "participation" as the only viable fix demonstrates that the move from "Appropriation" to "Appreciation" is not just an academic ideal, but a practical necessity recognized by emerging practitioners.

### VII. Conclusion (approx. 300 words)
*   **Recap:** Summarize that appropriation is a structural issue, not just an individual intention.
*   **Answer RQ:** Ethical navigation requires moving from *aesthetic borrowing* (stripping context) to *participatory understanding* (hermeneutics).
*   **Outlook:** A call for "Critical UX"—designers must act as "interfaces" (Schneider) who mediate cultures responsibly.

## 3. Tips for Writing (from your Guide)
*   **Red Thread:** Ensure the definition of "Power" links every chapter. The transition from *defining* the harm (Ch III) to *seeing* it in UX (Ch IV) to *solving* it (Ch V) is your narrative arc.
*   **Definitions:** When you introduce "Commodification," "Hermeneutics," or "Re-enculturation," define them immediately.
*   **Citation Strategy:**
    *   Use **Arya** for the broad definitions and the "Pizza Effect."
    *   Use **Matthes** for the ethical argument (oppression).
    *   Use **Schneider** for the solution (hermeneutics) and the concept of "stripping context."
    *   Use **Vasalou et al.** for the specific UX/Game design application.
    *   Use **Han** and **Kawasaki** for the practical frameworks (Appreciation vs. Appropriation, 3 Ps).
