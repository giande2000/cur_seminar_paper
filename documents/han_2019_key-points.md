### What Is Cultural Appreciation?

According to the Oxford Dictionary (2018), appreciation is “recognition and enjoyment of the good qualities of someone or something.” 

In an art class, when art teachers think about cultural appreciation, we are also concerned with how much recognition should be attributed to a culture and whether we are celebrating a culture or deepening a cultural stereotype.

### What Is Cultural Appropriation?

- **Basic Definition:**
Cultural appropriation refers to the ways people adopt or adapt an aspect of another’s culture and make it their own (Heyd, 2003; Hladki, 1994).
- **More Critically:**
When people within a dominant culture use objects from another culture without thorough research, and remain ignorant of the cultural context, cultural appropriation takes place.
- **Definition from Hart (1997):**
According to Hart (1997), cultural appropriation is “speaking for others or representing them in fictional as well as legal, social, artistic, and political work [as] appropriate or proper, especially when individuals or groups with more social, economic, and political power perform this role for others without invitation” (p. 137).

### From Appropriation to Appreciation

Key Actions (not really mentioned explicitly but derived from the content):

### 1. Start with Respect and Exchange

The "necessary preconditions" for this shift are **cultural exchange and mutual respect**. **Instead of a one-way "taking," appreciation is built on a two-way conversation.** My paper suggests creating an equal platform where people can celebrate and introduce their own cultures to others.

### 2. Ask Critical Questions (The 4 "W"s)

The line between appropriation and appreciation often depends on context and purpose. Before engaging with a cultural element, you must ask:

- **Who** is using it?
- **What** is it? (Is it a traditional costume, a sacred symbol, etc.?)
- For **what occasion** is it being used?
- For **what purpose** is it being used?

### 3. Do In-Depth Research

This is the most critical step. Appropriation often happens from ignorance of the cultural context. To move to appreciation, **you *must* research the cultural meaning** of the icons, styles, or colors. You need to find out if they are **sacred or significant** to that culture, as this determines if they are appropriate to use at all.

### 5. Be a Responsible Creator

As creators (or "prosumers" on social media), we must be **consciously aware of the power of our creations**. This means that if we create and post culturally relevant images, we must ensure we have done in-depth research and are **handling the images with respect and care**.
