### **Globalization and Internet as Urgency**

**globalization and the internet have made cultural appropriation an urgent ethical issue**. Because it's so easy for anyone to see and copy cultural elements online, there is a growing and necessary push—in law, in academia, and in public opinion—to **create real protections** for marginalized cultures.

### Push against cultural appropriation

Because it's so easy for anyone to see and copy cultural elements online, there is a growing and necessary push—in law, in academia, and in public opinion—to **create real protections** for marginalized cultures.

Here’s a simpler step-by-step breakdown:

- **1. The Problem is More Urgent:** Thanks to the internet and globalization, it’s easier than ever to access other cultures. This makes the "boundaries" between them fragile or "precarious". This new, easy access forces us to think seriously about the ethics of appropriation and how to share responsibly.
- **2. People Are Taking Action:** In response, there’s been a lot of progress to legally protect cultural heritage5. I mention official measures like the **UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists** and the **Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act** as key examples.
- **3. More Groups Are Helping:** It’s not just governments. More non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and even private companies are being created specifically to support the rights of indigenous groups.
- **4. The Law is Catching Up:** As I discuss later in Section 5.1, more legal scholars and lawyers are now actively trying to solve this—they're "grappling" with how to best represent and legally safeguard the rights of marginalized groups.
- **5. The Public is More Aware:** Finally, you see this topic in the news all the time. This media exposure has made the general public much more aware of the debates around cultural "entitlement" and rights.

### Point of View: Disagreement with the concerns about cultural appropriation

The author Lionel Shriver is a prominent example.

Here's her argument in simpler terms:

- **She thinks the criticism is a "passing fad"**: Shriver dismisses the entire concept, hoping it will just go away.
- **She sees it as "surveillance"**: She feels that criticizing writers for appropriation is like a destructive form of policing.
- **It's a threat to creativity**: Her main point, which she made in a famous 2016 speech, is that fiction writers *must* be able to "borrow" from other cultures. She argues their entire job is to imagine themselves in other people's shoes.
- **Fear leads to bad art**: She worries this "super sensitivity" will make writers too scared to create characters from different backgrounds. The result, she claims, will be fiction that is "anodyne"—or in simpler terms, bland and boring.

In my paper, I also mention the philosopher James O. Young, who makes a similar argument. He believes it's not ethically wrong to appropriate from other cultures as long as you give acknowledgment, arguing that to believe otherwise "curtails creativity".

These arguments essentially prioritize artistic freedom over the harms of appropriation that I outline.

**→ Artistic Freedom in UX?**

### Point of View: Moral Wrongness

In simple terms, ***Erich Hatala Matthes's*** "oppression account" provides a specific reason **why** cultural appropriation is **morally wrong**.

His argument is that the act of "taking" (appropriation) is not just a neutral exchange. Because it happens within a dynamic of power imbalance, the taking itself **actively increases the inequality and marginalization** that the less powerful group already suffers from.

So, for Matthes, the moral wrongness isn't just about hurt feelings or ownership; it's wrong because it is an act that **contributes to and reinforces systemic oppression**.

### Appropriation is Not Assimilation

- Assimilation is what happens when a marginalized group is pushed to adopt the practices of the dominant "host" society.
- The key point is that you **cannot compare** assimilation and appropriation as if they are equal.
- Why? Because the **inherent power imbalance** makes them totally different processes. One (assimilation) is often a survival mechanism for the marginalized group, while the other (appropriation) is an act of taking by the dominant group. &

### "Culture" Is a Fuzzy Concept

The problem is that to "appropriate" something, you first need to assume that cultures are fixed, separate 'boxes' with clear boundaries and clear-cut "insiders" and "outsiders".

Arya argues that this isn't how culture works. Culture is **"ambiguous"**, fluid, and always changing.

Culture is **"amorphous"** (shapeless) , **fluid**, and its boundaries overlap. People's identities are also layered, not singular. You can be an "insider" in one way (perhaps by ethnicity) but an "outsider" in another (perhaps by geography or social class).

---

A great example from my paper is **hip-hop**.

- **The "Box":** Hip-hop originated with African-Americans in New York's South Bronx in the 1970s as a powerful expression against poverty and racism5555. This seems like a clear "insider" group.
- **The "Fuzziness":** But hip-hop is now a global phenomenon6. In my paper, I note how disaffected ethnic minority youth in Europe, for example, have adapted hip-hop. They use its styles to communicate their *own* specific, local struggles with marginalization.
- **The Question:** Are they "insiders" or "outsiders"? They don't share the original cultural narrative, but they connect authentically with the founding *ethos* of resistance.

This shows how the "boundaries" of a culture aren't precise—they are fuzzy, changeable, and can be authentically adapted by other groups who share a similar *experience* of marginalization.

### Possible UX Example

A perfect example for UX designers is the very concept of a **user persona** or a **demographic target**.

### The "Box" vs. The "Fuzziness"

- **The "Box":** In design, you might be asked to create a product for "The Millennial User" or "The Gen Z User." This persona often comes with a list of essential attributes, like "digitally native," "values authenticity," or "prefers visual content." This creates a fixed, neat "box" that defines the "culture" of Gen Z.
- **The "Fuzziness":** My paper argues that culture is "ambiguous" and "contested"3. There is no single, unified "Gen Z culture." A 20-year-old's lived experience is shaped by overlapping, "interlocking" identities like their **social class, gender, geography, and ethnicity**.
- **The UX Challenge:** A 20-year-old in rural America has a completely different cultural framework and set of digital experiences than a 20-year-old in urban Japan. To treat them as one "culture" is to misunderstand them. As my paper notes, these overlapping identities can "pull in different directions"5.

So, for a UX designer, this "fuzziness" means that **relying on overly rigid cultural personas** is risky. It can lead to designs that feel hollow or, worse, reinforce stereotypes. It's why my paper argues these things are better evaluated over time ("diachronically") rather than as a fixed snapshot6666.

### Marginalized Culture

a **marginalized culture** is one that has been pushed to the fringes of society and holds relatively **less power** than the dominant, or majority, culture.

In the article, I specifically define a marginalized culture as **"either a minority or indigenous culture"**. These are groups that often **do not enjoy the same privileges or rights** to self-expression, have historically faced exploitation, and have had to fight for their rights and to create the terms that shape their own identities.

### Commodification

In simple terms, **commodification is the process of turning a cultural good or idea into an object of trade**—something that can be bought and sold.

When this happens, the item's original value is stripped away. Its social history, the conditions of its creation, and its deep cultural meaning are all masked and mystified.

In my paper, I explain this using a classic distinction:

- **Use Value:** What the item *is* and *means* within its culture (e.g., a sacred symbol).
- **Exchange Value:** What the item is *worth* commercially when it's sold as a product (e.g., a $20 t-shirt printed with that symbol).

Cultural appropriation is driven by this switch. The core issue is that **not everything is or should be for sale**.

---

### The "Spice" Analogy and Double Standards

A common practice is when a dominant culture takes elements from a marginalized culture purely for **aesthetic reasons**.

I use the writer bell hooks's powerful quote to describe this. She says "ethnicity becomes spice, seasoning that can liven up the dull dish that is mainstream white culture".

This leads to a harmful **double standard** I mentioned earlier:

- A person from a minority group is **ostracized** or stereotyped for the visible markers of their culture.
- When a white person adopts those *same markers*, it's suddenly seen as "exotic, desirable, and edgy".

This process **inverts the meaning**. The object, which might be a political symbol of oppression for the marginalized group, is **trivialized** and distorted into a simple fashion accessory.

---

## UX Example

Yes, an excellent example for designers is one I mention in the paper: the **commodification of religious icons**.

Imagine a wellness or yoga app. A UX designer might be tasked with creating a logo, interface elements, or loading-screen animations.

- **The Task:** The client wants the app to feel "spiritual," "authentic," or "exotic"1. They might suggest using traditional **Hindu religious icons** 2 as part of the app's aesthetic.
- **The Commodification:** The designer, following the brief, uses a sacred deity or symbol as a decorative button or a background pattern.
- **The Harm:** In this process, the icon's deep religious value is completely **stripped away** and **trivialized**. It's transformed from a sacred symbol into a mere aesthetic element to sell a product. This is a perfect example of what my paper calls the **"inversion of the meaning or value"** —taking something sacred and turning it into something commercial and superficial.

This is very similar to the examples I cite of high-fashion designers using these same icons on swimwear and underwear.

### Pizza-Effect / re-enculturation

<aside>

The "pizza-effect" (re-enculturation) is a specific *example* of the harmful commodification.

</aside>

The dominant culture **sells the new, re-packaged version back to the original culture**.

Because the dominant culture has so much influence (what my paper calls "**cultural imperialism**"), this new version is suddenly seen as more valuable, more prestigious, or more legitimate than the original.

The original culture then has to **"re-learn" or "re-enculturate" its own item** in this new, altered form.

---

### 🍕 The Pizza Example

This is exactly what happened with pizza:

1. **Original Item:** In Naples, it was a "simple food stuff"—just a hot flatbread with herbs.
2. **Taken & Changed:** Italian immigrants took it to the USA and transformed it with elaborate toppings and different sizes (creating what we now know as "pizza Americana").
3. **Sold Back:** This new, American-style pizza was then **exported back to Italy** after WWI.
4. **The Effect:** This "global identity" version became hugely popular in Italy, gaining a status the original, simple flatbread never had.

So, the "pizza-effect" is when a dominant culture acts like a **global trendsetter**, taking something from a marginalized culture, changing it, and selling it back to them as the "new and improved" version, which reinforces the dominant culture's power and distorts the original.

### UX Example

Yes, a great example for UX designers would be the **wellness and mindfulness app industry**.

1. **Original Item:** Think about practices like yoga and mindfulness, which have deep roots in Indian culture.
2. **Taken & Changed:** Western companies took these practices, often stripping them of their deep spiritual or philosophical context , and **re-packaged them** as a commercial, app-based wellness or fitness product. The user experience is designed to be sleek, data-driven (e.g., "streaks"), and focused on a quantifiable goal like "stress reduction" or "fitness."
3. **Sold Back:** This new, polished, Western-designed "yoga app" or "mindfulness subscription" is then exported and marketed globally, **including back to India**.
4. **The Effect:** Because this version has gained global prestige and "esteem... in the West", it becomes highly desirable *in India*. A user there might be more inclined to download a sleek, US-designed app to practice yoga, rather than learn from a traditional local source. They are, in effect, **re-learning their own cultural practice** through this new, commodified, Western-designed UX, which reinforces the dominant culture's power.

This is a perfect modern example of that process of "re-enculturation" I discuss.

### Postcolonial Perspective

Yes, it's highly relevant. This section explains the **historical "why"** behind the power imbalance you've been focused on.

For a UX presentation, this section gives you the **critical theory** to explain *why* simply "borrowing" an aesthetic isn't neutral—it's connected to a long history of powerful groups taking from less powerful ones.

Here is a simplified breakdown of Section 5.

---

### 🌍 What is the Postcolonial Perspective?

In simple terms, this is the main academic lens used to understand cultural appropriation1.

It argues that we can't understand "taking" today without looking at the history of **colonialism and imperialism**2. This history created the very power imbalances we're discussing.

- 
    
    **Legitimizing "Taking":** Colonial powers justified taking things by calling it a "civilising" or "salvaging" mission3.
    
- **Creating the "Other":** Academic fields like **anthropology** were originally part of this problem. They created a binary between the "civilised" West and the "savage" other, which made it easier to study and take from them4.
- **Museums as a Problem:** **Museums in the West** were also not neutral. Their collections were often built from this colonial "taking," and their exhibits reinforced these harmful narratives5.
- 
    
    **The Solution is "Hybridity":** Postcolonial theory argues that the idea of "pure" culture is a myth6. All cultures are actually **hybrid**—they are all mixed, fluid, and always changing7. The goal is to find a way for cultures to mix *without* the "imposed hierarchy" of colonialism8.
    

---

### 💡 Why This Matters for UX Design

This is the "Critical" part of your "Critical UX Reflections" talk.

1. **It Challenges UX Assumptions:** Just as this theory critiqued anthropology and museums, it gives you a powerful tool to critique your **own** design practices.
    - Are your **user personas** creating a simplistic, harmful binary of "us" (the default) vs. "them" (the "other" market)?
    - Is your **design process** (like creating mood boards) acting like a colonial museum, "taking" cool aesthetics from other cultures without their context or history?
2. **It Explains the "Pizza-Effect":** This perspective explains the *power dynamic* that makes the "pizza-effect" possible. The dominant culture (the West) has the power to define what is "modern" or "good design," which is why its re-packaged version is accepted as superior.
3. **It Offers a Better Goal ("Hybridity"):** Instead of "appropriation," the goal for a global UX designer could be **"hybridity."** This means asking:
    - "How can my design respectfully and authentically blend with the local culture?"
    - This is the difference between just applying a superficial "skin" (appropriation) and creating a truly localized, hybrid product that feels like it *belongs*.

In short, this section provides the **academic and ethical backbone** for your entire presentation.

Does that connection to UX make sense? We can now look at **Section 5.1**, which discusses how scholarship has changed to include *more* voices.

### Scholarship on Cultural Appropriation

Here's a short summary of Section 5.1.

This section explains that academic research ("scholarship") has moved beyond just talking *about* marginalized groups and is now trying to **include their actual voices**1.

This has led to three main developments:

1. 🗣️ **A "Plurality of Voices":** Researchers now create edited collections of essays that feature perspectives from people **inside and outside the academy**, including members of indigenous and minority communities2. This creates a more authentic (and sometimes conflicting) dialogue about who "owns" culture3.
2. ⚖️ **A Focus on Law:** There's been a surge in legal scholarship trying to figure out how to **legally protect the rights of marginalized groups**4444. This is hard because Western law often doesn't fit with indigenous ideas of collective ownership5. It's also trying to solve new problems, like how to protect **intangible goods** (like ideas and knowledge) in the digital age6.
3. 🤔 **New Philosophical Questions:** Analytical philosophy has also begun to seriously examine the topic7. Philosophers are digging into the foundational definitions and, importantly, the **normative questions**—that is, the ethical justifications for *why* cultural appropriation is right or wrong8.

Essentially, this section shows that the field is becoming more diverse, more practical (with law), and more ethically rigorous (with philosophy).

Would you like me to go over the final reflections in Section 6?

### Conclusion

Here's a simple summary of my concluding remarks.

This section essentially wraps up the entire argument by restating the most important points and looking to the future.

- **The Core Issue:** I re-emphasize that cultural appropriation **matters** because not all cultural sharing is equal1. The ethics of a dominant culture taking from a marginalized one is the central problem2.
- **The Urgency:** Globalization and the internet have made it easier to access other cultures, which increases the **urgency** of understanding how to share responsibly3.
- **The Biggest Challenge:** A key difficulty in this entire discussion is that the very concept of "culture" is **unstable and fluid**4.
- **Progress So Far:** Postcolonial thinking has helped shift the conversation. Scholarship now includes more voices from marginalized groups, allowing them to define themselves in their own terms5.
- **The Future:** The field has expanded, especially into **legal studies**, as we try to figure out how to protect things like intellectual property and intangible cultural goods6. This will ultimately benefit everyone by clarifying the rules of responsible sharing7. As a result, future cases of appropriation will likely be even more complex and "fraught"8.

This concludes the main points of my paper!

Do you feel you have a good grasp of the key topics now for your 'Critical UX Reflections' presentation?

### Appropriation vs. Appreciation

https://gemini.google.com/share/063dc222b561

<aside>
I want to provide my audience a framework as UX Designers to avoid appropriation but still feeling like having the freedom to explore and take inspiration from other cultures as appreciation

</aside>

That is the central challenge, isn't it? My paper argues that "sharing or experiencing cultures other than one's own is a rich part of human experience," but it "remains problematic because of the damage it may cause" 1, especially when that "taking" is unauthorized2.

The line between appreciation and appropriation is **not** about your intentions—my paper notes that appropriation is "often committed unintentionally or inadvertently but it does not mitigate the damage"3.

The difference is about **Power**, **Commodification**, and **Participation**.

Based on the core arguments of my paper, here is a practical framework for UX designers. You can call it the **"3 P" Framework**. Before you take inspiration, ask these three questions.

---

### 1. The "Power" Question: What is the context?

My paper is very clear that the central problem is the "asymmetry of power between two cultures"4. Appropriation is when the "majority/dominant culture [takes] from the marginalised culture"5.

- **Ask yourself:** Am I, as a member of a dominant culture, taking inspiration from a "marginalised, that is, is either a minority or indigenous culture"? 6
- **If the answer is no** (e.g., an American designer inspired by French impressionism), the power dynamic is not appropriative.
- **If the answer is yes**, you are in dangerous territory. The "taking" itself reinforces the "inequality and marginalisation" that already exists7. This is what Matthes calls the "oppression account"8. You must proceed with extreme caution to the next questions.

---

### 2. The "Profit" Question: Am I commodifying or trivializing?

This is the central harm I identify. **Commodification** is the "process by which a culture, in any or all of its aspects, is turned into an object of sale"9999. This process "distorts and misrepresents the culture"10.

- **Ask yourself:** Am I stripping this element of its "real value," its "social history" 11, and reducing it to its "exchange value"—its commercial worth? 12
- **Ask yourself:** Am I using this as bell hooks's "spice" or "seasoning" to "liven up the dull dish that is mainstream white culture"? 13
- **A UX Example:** Using a sacred Indigenous symbol as a "spiritual" loading icon for a wellness app. This "inverts the meaning" 14, taking something sacred and "trivialis[ing]" it into a mere aesthetic for a commercial product15.

---

### 3. The "Participation" Question: Who is involved and who benefits?

My paper highlights that a positive shift in scholarship has been the move toward a "plurality of voices" 16, including those from "indigenous and minority groups"17. This shows a path forward.

- **Ask yourself:** Am I "taking" this without authorization 18, or am I engaging in a genuine, respectful "dialogue"? 19
- **The Best Path (Appreciation):** Instead of *taking* inspiration, can you **collaborate**? Can you **hire** UX designers from that culture to lead the design? Can you ensure the source community has **agency** and **benefits** (financially or otherwise) from your project?
- **The Worst Path (Appropriation):** Copying an aesthetic you saw online, with no context, no credit, and no collaboration, for a commercial product.

---

### 💡 So, what's the difference? (A Guide for Designers) -> not actually part of the paper

Here is a simple table you can use in your presentation that summarizes the key differences based on my paper's arguments:

| **Appreciation (Responsible Sharing)** | **Appropriation (Harmful Taking)** |
| --- | --- |
| Seeks to learn and understand the **full context** and history. | Takes something as a "snapshot," ignoring its "social history". |
| Focuses on the "real value" (e.g., meaning, spirit, history). | Focuses on "exchange value" (e.g., aesthetics, commercial worth). |
| Is centered on **participation, dialogue, and permission**. It "decentre[s]" power. | Is an "unauthorised" act of "taking" by a dominant group. |
| **Credits** and (if commercial) **compensates** the source culture. | "Distorts and misrepresents" and "trivialis[es]" the source. |
| Requires the designer to be "critically... reflective and sensitive". | Is often done "unintentionally" but still causes "damage". |

The "freedom" to explore comes with the professional responsibility to be "critically and ethnographically reflective and sensitive"32. The goal is not to stop sharing, but to stop the "exploitation" 33and "damage" 34 that comes from thoughtless taking.

Does this "3 P" framework give you a clear, practical tool for your presentation?
